The exercise covered the following countries that received refugees from Ukraine: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

The protection profiling and monitoring involved household-level interviews conducted at border crossing points, reception and transit centres, collective sites, and assistance points in major cities using a structured questionnaire.

The result reflects the refugees' situation at the time of data collection.

The first round of data collection took place between May and Nov 2022. The focus of the first round was general profiling of Ukraine refugees and their needs, as well as key issues during the intial phase of the crisis such as family separation, etc.

(1) to provide a comprehensive baseline of refugee population needs on Bhasan Char; 
(2) to inform an evidence-based prioritisation and resource allocation to effectively plan and design programming activities around; 
(3) to harmonise data collection efforts to avoid duplication of efforts and resources, minimise intrusion into the lives of beneficiaries, and maintain compatibility, quality, and comparability; 
(4) to provide the basis for a joint multi-stakeholder needs analysis and interpretation process.

Due to the different ways of reaching the respondents - through their accommodation, through the Blue Dot centers, through the schools and among the Ukrainian refugee community, it is possible that there is an overlap between the respondents reached by the different approaches.

For the purposes of the analysis, groups were additionally constructed, depending on the type of accommodation that the refugees are residing in Bulgaria.

Jordan hosts 761,580 refugees, making it the fourth host country of refugees per capita in the world. To ensure that the basic needs of the most vulnerable are met, UNHCR provides cash assistance to recipients selected based on vulnerability criteria.
As of June 2022, cash assistance continues to have a positive effect on respondents’ psychological and financial wellbeing. In comparison to August 2021, more respondents reported that their wellbeing was improved significantly because of the programme. Just as in previous years, most respondents spent the cash assistance on basic needs, mainly rent (80%) and food (45%). While expenditure on rent has slightly increased since October 2021, fewer respondents spent the cash assistance on food, continuing a tendency of the past few years.
The percentage of respondents’ households holding debt reached 91%, the highest figure since late 2018. Meanwhile, food insecurity increased for non-Syrian and, even more substantially, for Syrian refugees, nearly closing the gap between the two groups. As most respondents could meet only half or less than half of their basic needs, many adopted coping strategies such as reducing expenditure for basic needs, buying food on credit or taking out loans. This year, 1 in 5 respondents also reported engaging in activities for money that may put their household at risk of harm, marking a 19-percentage point increase from the summer of 2021. 
Feedback on UNHCR communications and treatment remains largely positive. Most recipients surveyed received the cash assistance on time and in the expected amount, and most felt that they were treated with respect. Furthermore, there was an increase by 26 percentage points from August 2021 in the share of recipients who are aware of how they can report complaints and feedback to UNHCR. However, there were substantial variations in satisfaction levels among those who contacted UNHCR in the past year, with Syrians being the most likely and Yemeni the least likely to be satisfied with the support provided.

Specifically, the Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentrations of refugees per capita in the world. A series of overlapping political, economic and social crises in Lebanon has underpinned the vastly growing level of need across populations in the country. On the macroeconomic front, at the beginning of July 2022 the World Bank downgraded Lebanon to a lower-middle-income country for the first time in 27 years, after Lebanon’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had decreased from $55 billion in 2018 to $20.5 billion in 2021.1 The Lebanese lira has continued to lose value in 2022, reaching exchange rates close to LBP 43,000 to the United States dollar in the informal market in December 2022. The country depends heavily on imports, paid for in dollars; fluctuations in exchange rates thus have significant impacts on the prices of goods and services in the country. Inflation is still on the rise: between October 2019 and the time of data collection in June 2022 the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change of prices over time, rose by 1,066 per cent. In addition to these factors, the COVID-19 and more recent Cholera outbreaks have stretched the country’s health sector and resources to breaking point. As a result, Lebanon’s financial and humanitarian situation ranks among the most severe crises in the world today.

The 2022 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) is the tenth annual representative survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with the aim to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Since its first round of data collection and assessment, the VASyR has become an essential tool for planning, shaping decision-making and the design of needs-based programmes. The results of the VASyR are used by the 10 sectors in partnership under the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), in order to understand the situational changes in Lebanon and advocate for funding. The VASyR has also been used to build targeting models, for instance to predict socioeconomic vulnerability and allocate assistance accordingly.

UNHCR database of known Syrian refugees as of 2022 served as the sample frame. Cases with missing addresses were excluded. Sampling was based on a 30 x 7 two-stage cluster scheme initially developed by the World Health Organization. This method outlines a sample size of 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster which provides a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. Districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure similar representativeness with other governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each, yielding 90 cluster selections for each. The governorate of Baalbek Hermel is made up of only two districts, as such, and to ensure an adequate sample in that governorate, one additional cluster sample was considered.

The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family/household) under UNHCR databases. Using Emergency Nutrition Assesment (ENA) software, villages were selected using probability proportionate to size where villages with a larger concentration of refugees was more likely to be selected and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters, per district.

In order to estimate the sample size needed to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level, the following assumptions were used:
- 50% estimated prevalence
- 10% precision
- 1.5 design effect
- 5% margin of error

Using the above parameters, 165 cases per district/cluster selection was required, leading to a target of 5,000 cases nationally. Due to the known high level of mobility of the Syrian refugee population and based on experience in previous rounds of VASyR and other household level surveys, a 40% non-response rate was considered.",['Face-to-face [f2f]'],"The 2021 VASyR questionnaire collected data at the household level and individual level including demographics, legal documentation, safety and security, shelter, WASH, health, food security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, debt, coping strategies and assistance, as well as questions specifically relating to women, children and people with disabilities.
",,"Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district. Weighting was necessary to ensure that the geographical distribution of the population was reflected in the analysis and to compensate for the unequal probabilities of a household being included in the sample. The normalized weight was calculated for each district using the following formula:

UNHCR Malaysia conducted the survey in December 2022 with the help of 23 enumerators and successfully collected data from 718 households comprising of 1,760 individuals. Informed consent was obtained prior to the start of the interview. 
The average age of the respondents was 34 years (SD = 9 years). Majority of the households were male-headed (87%), married (55%), currently in some form of employment (83%) and originated from Myanmar (74%). Among the head of households, knowledge of available health services were lacking with a third of them (30.8%) unaware of subsidized care at government health facilities for UNHCR document holders while more than half of them were unaware of the availability of hospitalization assistance as provided by IMARET. Nevertheless, most households were able to access health care when needed (93%) although affordability remained a major barrier.  The average amount paid by households for primary health services was MYR164 while hospitalization care could cost as much as MYR5,197 on average. In terms of childhood vaccination, 78% children under 5 were able to receive measles or MMR vaccination mainly from government health facilities. However, it is worth noting that the finding did not indicate whether the children had completed the required doses for MMR. Access to reproductive health services remain challenging with slightly more than half of pregnant women faced difficulties accessing antenatal care due to financial barrier. The average cost of delivery care paid by the respondents was MYR3,600. In terms of family planning, only 45.1% received family planning counselling or services post-delivery. Non-communicable diseases were emerging as another health concern affecting as many as 10% of the total households. The top three most common NCD were hypertension, diabetes mellitus and musculo-skeletal diseases. As a result of inclusive national COVID-19 vaccination programme, refugees benefitted from the initiative with 92.6% completing the required doses and 74.6% receiving a booster dose. In summary, findings from this survey indicated the need to strengthen health awareness and information dissemination among refugees while sustainable health financing will help to ease the financial barrier faced by most refugees in need of health services.

The exercise covers the following countries that have received refugees from Ukraine: Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Republic of Moldova (5,035), Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

The protection monitoring involves household-level interviews conducted at border crossing points, reception and transit centres, collective sites, and assistance points in major cities using a structured questionnaire. Trained enumerators from UNHCR and partners collect data in face-to-face interviews. While respondents are randomly selected to reduce bias, the sample is considered a non-probability sample and results should be considered indicative, meaning they cannot be extrapolated to the population of refugees from Ukraine.

Darien is a transit location for thousands of refugees and migrants, most of them coming from Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba, and African and South Asian nations. 
According to official statistics of the Panamanian National Migration Service (SNM), from 2010 to 2020 some 120,000 people crossed through this area. In 2021 and 2022, Panama faced an unprecedented mixed movement crisis, with nearly 400,000 people making this perilous journey through the jungle. In 2022, a total of 248,284 people entered the country irregularly through Darien. 
Before they arrived at the Darien jungle, many of these refugees and migrants had previously crossed multiple countries often through unofficial border crossings, resulting in increased protection risks. These vulnerabilities were further exacerbated, during their journey through the jungle, by many risks and incidents which include, but are not limited to, thefts, physical and sexual attacks, murder, and extortion. Many of these refugees and migrants were also undocumented, limiting their access to basic services.

This PDM follows the multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) programme in Poland in response to the arrival of refugees from Ukraine. The programme was carried out in coordination with Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the Polish Centre for International Aid (PCPM). The objective of the programme was to address the basic needs of the refugees, relieve the financial burden of their households and put them on a path to sustainable solutions. The programme was initially aimed at all refugees that left Ukraine after 24 February 2022, with 126,304 refugee households (267,746 individuals) benefiting from cash assistance between 11 March and 26 July 2022. New criteria was introduced on 27 July, seeking to target the most vulnerable refugees. 9,945 households (22,2923 individuals) benefited from cash assistance between 27 July and 9 September 2022 according to the new criteria. 

A PDM assessment was carried out between August and September of 2022. It consisted of a structured household-level survey using a tool developed by UNHCR. The survey was administered via phone interviews to a representative sample of 1,260 beneficiary households who received CBIs, and was broken up into two strata:

The specific focus of the assessment was to identify priority needs of the refugee population in terms of access to basic services, social cohesion between refugees as well as host population, and local refugee response mechanisms.

The assessment used a mixed-methods approach, including data from secondary sources as well as primary qualitative and quantitative data. For the primary quantitative component, a set of structured household questionnaires were used: one for refugees and one for host households. The four geographic areas were decided as they were hosting the largest number of refugees at the time of the assessment. Temporary protection data was used to get an estimate of the refugees in the four cities assessed.

In these locations, large populations of refugee-returnees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities live together. Within these PARR locations, UNHCR implemented its short and medium-term Community-based Protection and Solutions Programme Response (CO-PROSPER) programmes to promote long-term development initiatives. UNHCR aimed to develop an area-based, humanitarian-development-peace triple nexus response to support durable solutions and create conducive conditions for the sustainable reintegration of displaced persons.
To understand the impact of these programmes on the PARR locations, IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT) conducted an evaluation of the impact of the programmes in PARR locations across four different dimensions: 1) community leadership inclusivity, 2) strengthening public services and equitable access, 3) income generation and economic empowerment, and 4) peacebuilding, and created indices to measure progress over these four key objectives that can be compared against the programme goals. 
In order to conduct this assessment, a mixed-method approach was used with two structured tools with separate methodologies to assess each site as follows. 
A HH level tool was used to interview a representative sample of HHs in each of the 20 PARR locations, with a 95% confidence level and a 10% margin of error. While aggregated (to the overall HH level) results are representative by population group (IDPs, refugee-returnees, and host communities) and by location, findings per population group in the locations are indicative only.

  In coordination with UNHCR and its partners, IMPACT developed a set of key indicators through which to conduct a Socioeconomic Vulnerability Assessment (SEVA) of household conditions across four key indices: 1) Community Leadership Inclusivity, 2) Service Quality and Access, 3) Livelihoods and Economic Outlook, and 4) Community Relations and Stability, as well as Key Vulnerability metrics. 
  These were administered as a household tool by trained enumerators to a random sample of households in each PARR location. Findings are statistically representative with a 95% confidence level and 10% margin of error for each of the 20 assessed PARR locations. at an aggregated level, findings are statistically representative with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error for each population group, as well as the entire sample, at an aggregated level, without disaggregating by site. 
  Sampling at site level: To sample at site level, enumerators started at the edge of the PARR location, and walked towards the centre, skipping a fixed number of households based on the population between interviews as the went. When they reached the middle of the PARR location, then would then turn around and travel back to their starting point, skipping  the same number of households as they went. Population data used for the sampling frames came from UNHCR's Reintegration and Partnerships Unit. 
  Only respondents above the age of 18, who either were the head o the household or could reasonably speak for them, were interviewed. Enumerators teams included both men and women to ensure that women could be interviewed, ensuring female voices in the data. In total, 25% of respondents were female.
  Analysis: Data was weighted and analyzed by site population.

To understand the impact of these programmes on the PARR locations, IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT) conducted an evaluation of the impact of the programmes in PARR locations across four different dimensions: 1) community leadership inclusivity, 2) strengthening public services and equitable access, 3) income generation and economic empowerment, and 4) peacebuilding, and created indices to measure progress over these four key objectives that can be compared against the programme goals. 
In order to conduct this assessment, a mixed-method approach was used with two structured tools with separate methodologies to assess each site as follows. 
A HH level tool was used to interview a representative sample of HHs in each of the 20 PARR locations, with a 95% confidence level and a 10% margin of error. While aggregated (to the overall HH level) results are representative by population group (IDPs, refugee-returnees, and host communities) and by location, findings per population group in the locations are indicative only. 
In addition, Key Informants (KIs) were interviewed to assess community leadership in each of the 20 PARR locations to provide indicative information on infrastructure, service presence, stakeholder presence, and conditions faced by specific displacement groups in each site. Nine KIs were interviewed in each location (except for three locations). 
Between 21 February and 5 March 2021, 2,039 HHs and 168 KIs were interviewed across all 20 PARR locations","Shash Pool and Qashqa, Nilli, Tarakhail Daag, Ghaziabad, Aka Khail Area, Laghmani, Qala-e-Nasro & Bini Warsak, Majboorabad, Charbagh, Daman, Shekh Mesri, Aziz Khan Kas, Noor Abad, Sakhi Camp & Qalin Bafan, Sher Khan Bandar, Loya Wala, Mirwais Mina, Kahdistan, Jebrial",Key Informant Interviews,Identified key informants representing targeted population groups,Aggregate data [agg],"The scope includes:

  Sampling at site level: To sample at site level, enumerators started at the edge of the PARR location, and walked towards the centre, skipping a fixed number of households based on the population between interviews as the went. When they reached the middle of the PARR location, then would then turn around and travel back to their starting point, skipping  the same number of households as they went. Population data used for the sampling frames came from UNHCR's Reintegration and Partnerships Unit. 
  Only respondents above the age of 18, who either were the head o the household or could reasonably speak for them, were interviewed. Enumerators teams included both men and women to ensure that women could be interviewed, ensuring female voices in the data. In total, 25% of respondents were female.
  Analysis: Data was weighted and analyzed by site population.

The information obtained through the survey was then enhanced and supplemented by information gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KII), which allowed for more nuanced and elaborated discussions and enabled UNHCR to capture the views of population groups (including children, youth, older refugees, persons with disabilities, female heads of households, LGBTIQ+ refugees, and parents of school-age children) whose voices are often under-represented.

UNHCR surveyed a representative sample of women and men and a range of age groups (15 to 17, 18 to 59, and 60 and over) among Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, and Thailand. The sampling methodology and sample sizes chosen ensured a low margin of error (7.5%) and provided a high degree of confidence (90%) that the results obtained from the portion of the population interviewed are representative of the views of the whole. This methodology also allows for statistically confident comparisons of the concerns and intentions of Rohingya refugees across different genders, ages, profiles, and countries of asylum. 

Due to their distinct profiles, experiences, and living situations, separate sample strata were drawn for two population groups in Bangladesh (Rohingya who arrived in the 1990s and those who have arrived since 2016) and in Indonesia (Rohingya living independently and those living in IOMsponsored accommodation).",Telephone interview,,"Consultations in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, and Thailand were completed prior to the events of 1 February 2021 in Myanmar.

These FGDs and KIIs made clear that these developments had not made a substantive difference in refugees’ thinking on the consultation topics.

Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are particularly affected. Since 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Far North region of Cameroon has steadily increased due to attacks by armed groups, in particular Boko Haram and rival groups. The situation of IDPs is worrying for the authorities.

In 2019, new waves of conflict and violence, associated with flooding, triggered more internal displacement. As of October 2021, the Far North region had 341,535 IDPs and 124,310 returnees (IOM DTM Round 22). In order to ensure the protection of IDPs in the three departments most affected in the Far North (Mayo-Sava, Mayo-Tsanaga et Logone-Et-Chari), a need was expressed by the different actors in the region and the authorities for credible detailed statistics on the IDP households and individuals that could be used for planning purposes. In this light, UNHCR supported the authorities in undertaking an IDP pilot profiling exercise between July and September 2021 in Mayo-Tsanaga.

The profiling collected data on a number of topics that could be used to assess the needs of the IDP population and identify solutions, namely living conditions, food security, essential items and legal protection.

The census is designed to provide information about people and housing units in Canada by their demographic, social and economic characteristics.

The Census of Population is a reliable basis for the estimation of the population of the provinces, territories and municipal areas. These counts are essential for maintaining Canada’s equitable representation, as they are used to set electoral boundaries; estimate the demand for services in minority official languages; and calculate federal, provincial and territorial transfer payments.

The census also provides information about the characteristics of the population and its housing within small geographic areas and for small population groups to support planning, administration, policy development and evaluation activities of governments at all levels. The information provided by the census for these geographic areas and population groups is also used by the private sector as well as data users in their decision-making process.

In 2021, for the first time, immigrant status and year of immigration was obtained from administrative files provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). These data provide vital information to help understand the living conditions and socioeconomic outcomes of immigrants and their children in Canada.

",Whole country,Household and individual,"The census enumerates the entire Canadian population, on a “usual residence” basis (de jure). The population enumerated consists of usual residents of Canada who are Canadian citizens (by birth or by naturalization), landed immigrants and non-permanent residents and their families living with them in Canada. Non-permanent residents are persons who hold a work or student permit, or who claim refugee status.

The census also counts Canadian citizens and landed immigrants who are temporarily outside the country on Census Day. This includes federal and provincial government employees working outside Canada, Canadian embassy staff posted to other countries, members of the Canadian Forces stationed abroad, all Canadian crew members of merchant vessels and their families. Because people outside the country are enumerated, the Census’ population concept is considered a “modified” de jure census.

Foreign residents such as representatives of a foreign government assigned to an embassy, high commission or other diplomatic mission in Canada, and residents of another country who are visiting Canada temporarily are not covered by the census.",Census/enumeration data [cen],"The scope includes:

The census reference date was May 11, 2021.

Collection included response by Internet, paper questionnaire, the Census Help Line, and failed-edit and non-response follow-up.

Statistics Canada used a wave methodology throughout the collection period to remind the majority of Canadians to complete their census questionnaires.
The first wave took place during the first week of collection when an invitation letter was sent out to most dwellings across the country. This first letter provided instructions on how to complete the questionnaire online with a secure access code, the date by which the questionnaire should have been completed, as well as the census website address and toll-free Census Help Line number for support. During the second week of collection, a reminder was sent to households that had not yet completed their questionnaire. This letter also provided instructions on how to complete the questionnaire, as well as the census website address and toll-free Census Help Line number for support. By the third week of collection, households that had not yet completed a questionnaire received a final notice informing them that a Statistics Canada representative was going to visit their household or contact them by phone to complete the questionnaire.
Statistics Canada subsequently conducted follow-up activities with non-responding households to complete their questionnaires, either door to door or by phone.

The 2021 Census of Population questionnaires (short and long-forms) were similar to those used in the 2016 Census, with some revised and new content.
","A weight was produced and associated with each responding household of the long-form sample. Persons, census families and economic families inherit the weight of their household. The weight was used to estimate population parameters.
A weight was first calculated for all the dwellings of the sample based on the sample design as the inverse of the probability of selection. In remote areas and Indian reserves, where the long form was used to collect the information of all households, this was the final weight and data imputation was performed for all cases of total and partial non-response.",[{'name': 'Statistics Canada'}],,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One area of support is for data collection to inform evidence-based policies that may help mitigate the effects of this crisis. Towards this end, a phone survey of 11 rounds were implemented in Burkina Faso. The last three rounds, implemented in May to July 2021 included a sample of internally displaced households.",,,"The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly having short term and long term impact on Burkinabe households’ welfare, impacting households through at least three broad channels: (i) the income/employment channel, which includes both labor and non-labor income, (ii) the price channel, and (iii) the long-term human capital channel. Most of these impacts are related to the direct health effect, but also to the containment measures that systematically altered socio-economic activities, resulting in a reduction of income across the board. Due to the urgent need for timely data and the limits on face-to-face surveys, the World Bank and the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) decided to implement a high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3768) to monitor the effects of COVID-19 on households, leveraging the available household phone number in the 2018/19 Enquete Harmonisée sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages (EHCVM). 
In Burkina Faso, the forcibly displaced persons (FDP) include both refugees and internal displaced population. For security related issues, FDPs are predominantly internal displaced people (IDPs). According to recent studies, the number of internally displaced people soared from 87,000 in January 2019 to over 1 million in August 2020, an increase of more than 1000 per cent (Conseil National de Secours d'Urgence et de Réhabilitation – CONASUR, 2020). The unprecedented levels of displacement occurred as the coronavirus pandemic worsens an already critical humanitarian crisis in the violence-stricken country. This critical situation calls for the need of timely data and analysis especially during a pandemic for this vulnerable group in order to better inform policy and targeting programs. Given the mutual interest of the INSD, WB-UNHCR Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement (JDC), UNHCR, and World Bank, decision was made to further expand the sample of the high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) to include IDPs for a total of three consecutive rounds. 
The core survey questionnaire of the Burkina Faso High Frequency Phone Survey on IDPs (BFA HFPS-IDP) is designed to cover important and relevant topics like employment, access to basic services and items, and non-labor sources of income. The core questionnaire is complemented by questions on selected topics that rotate each month, including knowledge of Covid-19 spread, social distancing and behavior, coping mechanisms to shocks, fragility, conflict and violence. Selected topics may be investigated more in detail in specific rounds.

The BFA HFPS-IDP is fielded alongside the Burkina Faso Covid-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of national households. Rounds 1, 2 and 3 of data collection for the HFPS-IDP occur simultaneously with round 9, 10 and 11 of the national HFPS operation, respectively.","The survey covers households from 9 of the 13 regions of Burkina Faso.

The CONASUR has been developed and supported by the government of Burkina Faso with the technical and financial support of development partners, including UNHCR, IOM and OCHA. The CONASUR database is updated regularly, and has exhaustive list of refugees and IDPs, along with few socio-demographic characteristics, as well as information on the phone numbers of households. The sample is drawn from the 9 regions (out of 12) where the presence of IDPs is more relevant: Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades, Centre-Est, Centre-Nord, Est, Hauts-Bassins, Nord, Plateau Central, Sahel. It is important to note that the BFA HFPS-IDPs is representative of households that have access to phones. Taken that into consideration, a key concern is the bias introduced by sampling households with at least a phone number, as phone penetration in some regions/areas might be limited. However, according to data from the CONASUR database, the percentage of households with at least one phone number is very high, accounting for above the 74% in all the sampled regions.
To account for non-response and attrition, 1500 households were selected in baseline round of the HFS. 1,166 households were fully interviewed during the first round of interviews.

All the interview materials were translated in French for the INSD. The questionnaire was administered in local languages with about varying length (about 25 minutes).","The survey was conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) techniques. The survey team was composed of 20 enumerators and 5 supervisors. Each enumerator was given a tablet and mobile phone (including sim card and data bundles) to be used for the interviews. The household questionnaire was implemented using the CAPI software Survey Solutions.

ORGANIZATION OF FIELDWORK: Data were collected by trained INSD interviewers who individually made phone calls from their respective homes. Since the country was on lockdown during the preparation and data collection exercise for the baseline round, interviewers were not allowed to be in the office. Therefore, all interviews were conducted from interviewers’ homes. Although the lockdown restrictions were partially lifted following the baseline, interviewers will continue to conduct interviews from home in subsequent rounds until it is deemed safe for them to return to the office. Every day, completed and partially completed call were reviewed and data were synchronized each evening.","To obtain unbiased estimates from the sample, the information reported by households needs to be adjusted by a sampling weight (or raising factor) w_h. To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), which outlines eight steps, of which we follow six, to construct the sampling weights for the BFA-HFPS:
1. Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on household characteristics as well as the characteristics of the dwelling. While the CONASUR database is limited in the number of socioeconomic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the CONASUR database.","[{'name': 'Institut National de la Statistique et de la Démographie', 'abbreviation': 'INSD', 'affiliation': 'Gouvernement du Burkina Faso'}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

RESPONDENTS: Each round of the Burkina Faso COVID-19 HFPS has ONE RESPONDENT per household. The respondent was the household head or a knowledgeable adult household member. The respondent must be a member of the household. Unlike many other household surveys, interviewers were not expected to seek out other household members to provide their own information. The respondent may still consult with other household members as needed to respond to the questions, including to provide all the necessary information on each household member.

Interviewers were instructed to make every effort to reach the same respondent in subsequent rounds of the survey, in order to maintain the consistency of the information collected. However, in cases where the previous respondent was not available, interviewers would identify another knowledgeable adult household member to interview.","Before being granted access to the dataset, all users have to formally agree:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.

UNHCR supported 109 refugee households in 11  provinces in China with cash assistance in Quarter 2, 2021. The CBI PDM was conducted between June and July 2021 to assess outcomes of the assistance. More than half the households receiving cash assistance are individuals without family. UNHCR’s cash assistance is beneficial to its recipients as respondents point to  improved living conditions (90%), relieved financial burdens (90%/75) and reduction in feeling of stress (96%). In terms of coping strategies, almost 68% of all beneficiaries had to take out a new loan or borrowed money over the last three months.","The survey covers 12 provinces and most respondents are from Guangdong.

The objective of the assessment was to assess the relevance of UNHCR and WFP's targeting in the context of Burundian refugees and possibly develop a targeting strategy harmonized as much as possible with other refugee populations in DRC.

A secondary objective was to introduce barcodes linked to unique identifiers used in registration. This vulnerability assessment was conducted through an exhaustive inventory of all refugee households living in the Lusenda and Mulongwe camps (South Kivu) as well as those living outside the camps and who went to the interview locations in the camps. The survey targeted Burundian refugee households assisted by WFP and UNHCR. The data collected during the survey are quantitative and were supplemented by qualitative data collected in February 2021 in the camps of Lusenda and Mulongwe through four focus group discussions per camp for a total of eight focus groups. All refugee households in Lusenda and Mulongwe camps as well as those living outside the camp, were interviewed with a core set of questions (see variable `TypeEnquete`, response `Ciblage`). In addition, 7% of households, randomly selected, participated in a more detailed interview (see variable `TypeEnquete`, response `Exhaustive`). A total of 7,873 households were selected.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The Government of Lebanon (GoL) estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the conflict since 2011. The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentration of refugees per capita in the world. 

The 2021 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) was the ninth annual survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Considering the prolonged socio-economic status in Lebanon and COVID-19, it was crucial to provide needs-based estimates on Syrian refugees in the country. Since VASyR 2021 was one of the few assessments that were conducted face-to-face, the implementation was accompanied by a comprehensive protocol to ensure the safety of families and field workers. The criticality of conducting the VASyR 2021 was to provide insights about Syrian refugees impacted by the political and economic crisis that hit Lebanon in late 2019 and by the COVID-19 outbreak.",National coverage,Household and individual,,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

UNHCR database of known Syrian refugees as of 2021 served as the sample frame. Cases with missing addresses were excluded. Sampling was based on a ""30 x 7"" two-stage cluster scheme initially developed by the World Health Organization. This method outlines a sample size of 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster which provides a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. Districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure similar representativeness with other governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each, yielding 90 cluster selections for each. The governorate of Baalbek Hermel is made up of only two districts, as such, and to ensure an adequate sample in that governorate, one additional cluster sample was considered.

The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family/household) under UNHCR databases. Using Emergency Nutrition Assesment (ENA) software, villages were selected using probability proportionate to size where villages with a larger concentration of refugees was more likely to be selected and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters, per district. 

In order to estimate the sample size needed to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level, the following assumptions were used: 
- 50% estimated prevalence
- 10% precision
- 1.5 design effect 
- 5% margin of error

Using the above parameters, 165 cases per district/cluster selection was required, leading to a target of 5,000 cases nationally. Due to the known high level of mobility of the Syrian refugee population and based on experience in previous rounds of VASyR and other household level surveys, a 40% non-response rate was considered.",Face-to-face interview,"The 2021 VASyR questionnaire collected data at the household level and individual level including demographics, legal documentation, safety and security, shelter, WASH, health, food security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, debt, coping strategies and assistance, as well as questions specifically relating to women, children and people with disabilities.","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enumerator training took place remotely. Separate enumerator trainings were carried out online for each operational region (Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, North and South) covering the data collection tool, contextual background, methodology and ethical considerations. Additionally, enumerators were required to attend a two-hour online COVID-19 training, provided by the Lebanese Red Cross, which covered key information about the virus, transmission and precautionary methods. Data was collected and entered on electronic tablets by the enumerators during the interviews using KoBo toolbox software.","Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district. Weighting was necessary to ensure that the geographical distribution of the population was reflected in the analysis and to compensate for the unequal probabilities of a household being included in the sample.

A total of 8871 household surveys were completed across 45 baladiyas (ADM3) in Libya. 

Due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and safety measures, all surveys took place over the phone. A non-probability, quota based sampling methodology was established, to ensure an accurate and robust cross-section of the Libyan population. Quotas were established for baladiyas (quota 1) and sub-groups within the population (non-displaced, IDPs, and returnees) (quota 2). Findings presented are not representative, and should be read only as indicative. 

Sampling of respondents was done primarily through Civil Society Organisation (CSO) networks, municipalities, International Non-Government Organisation (INGO) partners, and various local committees. 1000 of the total number of surveys were sampled through Random Digit Dialing (RDD) by a Libyan company specialized in this methodology.

- Why is epilepsy (especially among children) so high? (e.g. is it related to other
illnesses – such as Nodding Syndrome in South Sudan and Uganda)
- Why is there such a huge number of children and youth with disabilities compared to adults and older people? (e.g. is that due to the house-to-house methodology, the questions asked, have adults and older people migrated less to safer IDP sites, etc)

In Phase 1, the NBS conducted 12 rounds of monthly phone interviews with over 1,700 households that were selected from the General Household Survey-Panel (GHS-Panel) 2018/19.

The GHS-Panel sample includes 4,976 households that were interviewed in the post-harvest visit of the fourth wave in January/February 2019. This sample of households is representative nationally as well as across the 6 geopolitical Zones that divide up the country.  In every visit of the GHS-Panel, phone numbers are collected from interviewed households for up to 4 household members and 2 reference persons who are in close contact with the household in order to assist in locating and interviewing households who may have moved in subsequent waves of the survey. This comprehensive set of phone numbers as well as the already well-established relationship between NBS and the GHS-Panel households made this an ideal frame from which to conduct the NLPS in Nigeria.

Among the 4,976 households interviewed in the post-harvest visit of the GHS-Panel in 2019, 4,934 (99.2%) provided at least one phone number. Around 90 percent of these households (4,440) provided a phone number for at least one household member while the remaining 10 percent only provided a phone number for a reference person. For the second phase of the NLPS, all 4,440 GHS-Panel households with household member contact details were included in the sample to be contacted. This included the sample of households from the first phase of the NLPS who had household member contact details (2,701 of 3,000). Based on the response rate in the first phase of the NLPS of 65 percent, this was expected to yield an interviewed sample of nearly 2,900 households that is both nationally representative as well as representative of urban and rural areas of the country. 

ROUND 2: Interviewers attempted to contact and interview all 2,922 households that were successfully interviewed in the baseline (round 1) of the NLPS Phase 2. The second round of the NLPS Phase 2 also included individual-level data collection on the migration history of household members. For the migration module, information on adult (15 years or older) members of the household was targeted, including respondents that fall into this age range. However, information was not captured for all adult members. In order to limit the burden for respondents and interviewers in cases where the number of adult members is large, a maximum of 6 household members were selected (in addition to the main respondent) to capture information on migration. Therefore, for households with less than 6 adult members, all eligible members were included. However, 93 percent of interviewed households had 6 or less adult members and only 7 percent had more than six. For the 7 percent with more than 6 adult members, 6 members were randomly selected from among the pool of eligible members. The selection was stratified by sex with an equal split of 3 male and 3 females was targeted, depending on the pool of eligible males and females. However, the application of selection as relatively rare.

ROUND 3: Interviewers attempted to contact and interview all 2,811 households that were successfully interviewed in the baseline (round 1) of the NLPS Phase 2, excluding 41 households that refused in Round 2. The third round of the NLPS Phase 2 also included individual-level data collection on employment and job history of household members. For the employment and job history modules, information on adult (15 years or older) members of the household was targeted, including respondents that fall into this age range. However, information was not captured for all adult members. In order to limit the burden for respondents and interviewers in cases where the number of adult members is large, a maximum of 4 household members were selected (in addition to the main respondent) to capture information on employment and job history. Therefore, for households with less than 4 adult members, all eligible members were included. 

However, 90 percent of interviewed households had 4 or less adult members and only 10 percent had more than four. For the 10 percent with more than 4 adult members, 4 members were randomly selected from among the pool of eligible members. The selection was stratified by sex with an equal split of 2 male and 2 females was targeted, depending on the pool of eligible males and females. The selection of eligible household members in Round 3 was conditional to the selection conducted in Round 2 for the migration module. In that round, up to 6 household members were selected (15 years or older) to answer the migration module. However, the application of selection as relatively rare.

ROUND 4: Interviewers attempted to contact and interview all 2,852 households that were successfully interviewed in the baseline (round 1) of the NLPS Phase 2, excluding 70 households that refused in previous rounds of the survey.

ROUND 5: Interviewers attempted to contact and interview 2,824 households consisting of households that were successfully interviewed in the baseline (round 1) of the NLPS Phase 2 excluding 98 households that refused in previous rounds of the survey.",['Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati]'],"BASELINE (ROUND 1): One questionnaire, the Household Questionnaire, was administered to all households in the sample.

ROUND 3: One questionnaire, the Household Questionnaire, was administered to all households in the sample. The Household Questionnaire provides information on demographics; access to health services; employment; job history; and COVID-19 vaccine.

ROUND 4: One questionnaire, the Household Questionnaire, was administered to all households in the sample. The Household Questionnaire provides information on demographics; access to health services; petrol; employment; credit; and economic sentiments. While the Household Questionnaire was administered to all the sample households, economic sentiments questions were asked to only half of the sample households (randomly selected).

ROUND 5: One questionnaire, the Household Questionnaire, was administered to all households in the sample. The Household Questionnaire provides information on demographics; access to health services; employment; COVID-19 vaccine; economic sentiments; and farmer screening.  While the Household Questionnaire was administered to all the sample households, economic sentiments questions were administered to only half of the sample households (those that were not selected to answer these questions in Round 4).","ORGANIZATION OF FIELDWORK: Data were collected by trained NBS interviewers who individually made phone calls either from a dedicated call center established in NBS headquarters or from their respective homes. Interviewers were allowed to make calls from home due to capacity constraints in the call center as well as social distancing measures undertaken in the office. While interviewers would occasionally meet in the office, most correspondence with the interviewers was made through WhatsApp, phone and emails.

GIFTS TO HOUSEHOLD: As a show of appreciation for the households&amp;#8217; participation, all households that gave consent to be interviewed, were transferred 1000 Naira credit to their phones (even if their interviews are only partially completed). The transfers are made to successfully interviewed households in every round. Since some of the sampled households do not have personal phone numbers, they were interviewed via a reference person&amp;#8217;s phone. These reference persons were also credited 1000 Naira credit to their phones when the households are successfully interviewed via their phones.

PRE-LOADED INFORMATION: Basic information on every household was pre-loaded in the CATI assignments for each interviewer. The information was pre-loaded to (1) assist interviewers in calling and identifying the household and (2) ensure that each pre-loaded person is properly addressed and easily matched to the most recent interviews. Basic household information (location, household head name, phone number, etc.) was pre-loaded. The list of individuals from the previous interview and their basic characteristics were uploaded. This helped maintain the panel of individuals and ensured the status of each individual in the subsequent round of the survey.

RESPONDENTS: Each round of the Nigeria NLPS Phase 2 has ONE RESPONDENT per household. The respondent was the household head or a knowledgeable adult household member. The respondent must be a member of the household. Interviewers were instructed to make every effort to reach the same respondent in subsequent rounds of the survey, in order to maintain the consistency of the information collected. However, in cases where the previous respondent was not available, interviewers would identify another knowledgeable adult household member to interview.

DATA MONITORING AND EVALUATION: As an additional aid to ensuring good quality data, extensive monitoring was performed throughout the fieldwork for each round of the survey. Two monitoring exercises were implemented during data collection. First, Survey Solutions&amp;#8217; audio recording functionality was activated for 25 percent of the sample. These interview recordings were audited by 3 trained monitors, though not all recorded interviewers were able to be reviewed due to personnel constraints. On a daily basis, the monitors will listen to these recordings and fill in a structured questionnaire with their observations on interviewer performance. The feedback from these audio audits are then filtered to the respective interviewers. 

The second quality check implemented were call backs to contacted households. The call backs were conducted by trained interviewers who are not part of the main data collection interviewers. Each day, up to 36 households that were contacted by the interviewing team are called by these call back interviewers. The call back interviewers conduct a short interview with the household to confirm that the interviewer did indeed conduct the interview, that certain key elements were clearly stated to the respondent, that the interviewer conducted themselves in a professional manner, and other details on the interview process. Further, the call back team asked several time-invariant questions of the respondent to further confirm the interview was fully conducted and the interviewer captured the information correctly. Feedback from call backs were routed to the respective interviewers to improve on identified areas. Further, the call back interviewers also called households that were not successfully contacted by the main interviewer. In some cases, the call back interviewer was able to reach the household. In such cases, the case was sent back to the interviewer to conduct the interview.

As a result of these quality checks, some of the interviewers were dropped from participating in the survey. There were also regular check-ins to address questions and issues the interviewers might have.","BASELINE (ROUND 1): In order to produce national estimates from the successfully interviewed sample, weights must be applied to the information provided by sampled households. Weights for the GHS-Panel serve as the basis for the Nigeria NLPS surveys, but the weights must be adjusted to reflect the selection and interviewing process. The weights for the Nigeria NLPS were calculated in several stages.

1. Begin with the GHS-Panel full sample household weights.
2. Apply an adjustment factor for the selection into the frame (GHS-Panel households that have contact details for a household member). A ratio adjustment was applied at the Zone-level (the strata for the GHS-Panel) to preserve the sum of household weights within each Zone between the full GHS-Panel sample and the NLPS frame.
3. Apply an adjustment for selection into the NLPS sample. The adjustment is a simple expansion factor that is the inverse of the selection probability from the frame for each sampled unit.
4. Apply an adjustment factor for non-contact of sampled households. This was again performed with a ratio adjustment at the Zone-level.
5. Apply an adjustment factor for non-response of contacted households through a ratio adjustment at the Zone-level.
6. Calibrate the weights (following adjustments 2-5) according to the properties of the full weighted GHS-Panel sample. This calibration step adjusts the weights such that the estimates obtained from the final NLPS sample will match the weighted means of the full GHS-Panel sample for specified characteristics. The calibration was performed using only information obtained from the GHS-Panel interview and thus will only reflect changes in the sample composition and not changes over time. The calibration applied here aims to correct for selection bias that is introduced at any point between identification of the frame and the final successfully interviewed sample. Selection bias is of particular concern in phone surveys since some segment of the population does not have access to a phone and there are more difficult barriers to successfully reach and interview households over the phone. The calibration was applied using the ReGenesees package in R. The characteristics included in the calibration were numerous, reflecting different dimensions of household socioeconomic status that were correlated with nonresponse. Characteristics include consumption expenditure, household size sex of household head, marital status of the household head, age of the household head, education of the household head, working status of the household head, asset ownership, access to electricity, improved water source, improved sanitation facilities, access to financial services, land ownership, agricultural activities, as well as demographic breakdown according to sex and 8 age groups (0-6, 7-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 years and older). The weights were also applied to the total number of households in the population given by the GHS-Panel weights.
7. Trim the weights. Outlier weights were trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles using the ReGenesees package in R which adjusts the weights to given bounds while minimizing the deviation from the estimates obtained from the calibration in step 6.

In subsequent rounds of the survey, steps 4, 5, and 6 will be applied to the final baseline weights.

The baseline (round 1) weights are located in the household-level data file (p2r1_sect_a_2_5_6_9a_12.dta) under the variable name wt_p2round1.

ROUND 2: In Round 2, several different weights are provided: one at the household-level and three at the individual-level. The household weights are the same as was provided in previous round. For the household weights, the baseline (round 1 of phase 2) weights were adjusted for noncontact and nonresponse as well as calibrated following the same procedures outlined in Round 1 (steps 4, 5 and 6). The round 2 household weights can be found in the household-level data file (p2r2_sect_a_2_2a_2b_6_12) in the variable named wt_p2round2.

Given the focus on individual migration information in round 2 and the selection steps outlined above for the sample of adult members, an additional three individual-level weights were calculated and provided in the round 2 data. The individual weights for the migration module were calculated according to:

w_ish=w_h x (n_hs/N_hs )^(-1)

Where w_ih is the sampling weight for individual i who is sex s (male or female) in household h, w_h is the final household level weight (i.e., wt_p2round2), N_hs is the total number of eligible adult household members (15 years or older) of sex s in household h and n_hs is the equivalent number of selected eligible individuals in the household. The individual weights were then calibrated to correspond to the sex and age distribution of the total adult population according to the post-harvest visit of the GHS-Panel. The age groups considered in the calibration were 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 years or older, all further disaggregated by sex (male/female).

The basic individual weight described above is the cross section individual weight that considers all individuals that migration information was collected on. This weight is called wt_migr_p2r2 and can be found in the individual-level data file (p2r2_sect_2_2a). However, an additional two weights are provided for the panel of individuals interviewed in the GHS-Panel wave 4 and round 2 of the NLPS Phase II (i.e., excluding individuals added in any round of the NLPS). The first weight (wt_migr_p2r2_pp_panel) contains the weight for individuals interviewed in the post-planting visit of the GHS-Panel wave 4 and the second (wt_migr_p2r2_ph_panel) contains the weight for individuals interviewed in the post-harvest visit of the GHS-Panel wave 4.

ROUND 3: In Round 3, several different weights are provided: two at the household-level and three at the individual-level. The two household weights provided are cross section and panel weights. The cross section weights are applicable to the entire round 3 sample while the panel weights are only applicable to round 3 sample households that have been successfully interviewed in all three rounds of phase 2 of the survey so far.   For both of the household weights, the baseline (round 1 of phase 2) weights were adjusted for noncontact and nonresponse as well as calibrated following the same procedures outlined in section 2.2 (steps 4, 5 and 6). The round 3 household weights can be found in the household-level data file (p2r3_sect_a_2_5_6_6c_9a_12.dta) with the cross section weights in the variable named wt_p2round3 and the panel weights in the variable named wt_p2round3_panel.

Given the focus on individual employment and job history information in round 3 and the selection steps outlined above for the sample of adult members, an additional three individual-level weights were calculated and provided in the round 3 data. The individual weights for the employment and job history modules were calculated according to:

w_ish=w_h x (n_hs/N_hs )^(-1)

Where w_ih is the sampling weight for individual i who is sex s (male or female) in household h, w_h is the final household level weight (i.e., wt_p2round3), N_hs is the total number of eligible adult household members (15 years or older) of sex s in household h and n_hs is the equivalent number of selected eligible individuals in the household. The individual weights were then calibrated to correspond to the sex and age distribution of the total adult population according to the post-harvest visit of the GHS-Panel (The age groups considered in the calibration were 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 years or older, all further disaggregated by sex (male/female). 

The basic individual weight described above is the cross section individual weight that considers all individuals that migration information was collected on. This weight is called wt_emp_p2r3 and can be found in the individual-level data file (p2r3_sect_2_6b_6c.dta). However, an additional two weights are provided for the panel of individuals interviewed in the GHS-Panel wave 4 and round 2 of the NLPS Phase II (i.e., excluding individuals added in any round of the NLPS). The first weight (wt_emp_p2rr_pp_panel) contains the weight for individuals interviewed in the post-planting visit of the GHS-Panel wave 4 and the second (wt_emp_p2r3_ph_panel) contains the weight for individuals interviewed in the post-harvest visit of the GHS-Panel wave 4.

ROUND 4: In Round 4, two different household weights are provided: cross section and panel weights. The cross section weights are applicable to the entire round 4 sample while the panel weights are only applicable to round 4 sample households that have been successfully interviewed in all four rounds of phase 2 of the survey so far.   For both of the household weights, the baseline (round 1 of phase 2) weights were adjusted for noncontact and nonresponse as well as calibrated following the same procedures outlined in section 2.2 (steps 4, 5 and 6). The round 4 household weights can be found in the household-level data file (p2r4_sect_a_2_5_5g_6_11a_11b_12.dta) with the cross section weights in the variable named wt_p2round4 and the panel weights in the variable named wt_p2round4_panel.

ROUND 5: In Round 5, two different household weights are provided: cross section and panel weights. The cross section weights are applicable to the entire round 5 sample while the panel weights are only applicable to round 5 sample households that have been successfully interviewed in all five rounds of phase 2 of the survey so far.   For both of the household weights, the baseline (round 1 of phase 2) weights were adjusted for noncontact and nonresponse as well as calibrated following the same procedures outlined in section 2.2 (steps 4, 5 and 6).

Of those contacted, 93 percent or 2,922 households were fully interviewed. These 2,922 households constitute the final successful sample and will be contacted in subsequent rounds of the survey. Among those household that were contacted, only 121 refused to be interviewed (about 4% of successfully contacted households). Among the sample of households who were not successfully contacted, the predominant reason for noncontact was that the phone was switched off at every attempt (18% of all households). Wrong numbers and non-existent numbers were also present but less common affecting only 4.8 and 2.5 percent of sampled households while for 2.6 percent of households the phone was ringing (and thus an active line and phone) but no one was answering.

ROUND 2: 2,797 households (95.7% of the 2,922 attempted) were contacted and 2,750 (94.1%) were successfully interviewed in the second round. Of those contacted, 36 households refused outright to be interviewed and 10 were partially interviewed. For the individual-level data collection, of 7,653 adult members of the household in round 2 (excluding the main respondent), information was collected on 7,058 or about 92.2 percent of eligible individuals. In addition, 2,750 main respondents were interviewed bringing the final sample of adult members with migration information to 9,808. Although interviewers made attempts to collect migration information directly from each individual selected, it proved exceedingly difficult to do so. As a result, only 34.6% of individual responses were obtained from the actual individual in question with the remaining 65.4% being collected via proxy (typically provided by the main respondent).

ROUND 3: 2,694 households (93.5% of the 2,881 attempted) were contacted and 2,647 (91.9%) were successfully interviewed in the third round. Of those contacted, 21 households refused outright to be interviewed and 22 were partially interviewed. Of the 2,647 successfully interviewed households, 2,575 were households that have been successfully interviewed in all three rounds of the phase 2 survey so far. The third round of the NLPS Phase 2 also included individual-level data collection on employment and job history of household members. For the individual-level data collection, of 7,887 adult members of the household in round 3 (excluding the main respondent), information was collected on 5,942 or about 75.3 percent of eligible individuals. In addition, 2,665 main respondents were interviewed bringing the final sample of adult members with employment information to 8,597.

ROUND 4: 2,646 households (92.8% of the 2,852 attempted) were contacted and 2,605 (91.3%) were successfully interviewed in the fourth round. Of those contacted, 25 households refused outright to be interviewed and 8 were partially interviewed. Of the 2,605 successfully interviewed households, 2,431 were households that have been successfully interviewed in all four rounds of the phase 2 survey so far.

ROUND 5: 2,610 households (92.4% of the 2,824 attempted) were contacted and 2,574 (91.1%) were successfully interviewed in the fifth round. Of those contacted, 25 households refused outright to be interviewed and 5 were partially interviewed.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Against the background of ever-limited resources and recognizing that the refugee population is not homogeneously vulnerable, in mid-2021 WFP and UNHCR initiated the shift to the targeted provision of food assistance based on needs.
  A targeting strategy – developed by UNHCR and WFP with support from the Joint UNHCR-WFP Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub - was formulated with the following objectives:
- Identify vulnerable refugee households in need of humanitarian assistance and less vulnerable refugees with higher livelihood resilience who would benefit from livelihoods support;
- Ensure the greatest protection outcomes through strong community participation, communications with refugee communities and risk analysis to inform the approach.
  This second JPDM has served to ensure that the corporate practice of post-distribution monitoring is fulfilled. Additionally, it assessed the extent to which the targeting approach has – over a period of five months between May and September 2021 – achieved the above objectives. 
  Overall vulnerability among refugee households – defined by livelihood resilience, economic capacity and food access - reduced over a period of nine months between December 2020 and September 2021","Six refugee camps across the country: Kigeme, Gihembe, Kiziba, Mahama, Mugombwa and Nyabiheke",Households,"All registered refugees in UNHCR register server, ProGres, in Rwanda.",Sample survey data [ssd],"Household: Demographics, food security, income generation and COVID-19 impact, expenditure and capacity to meet needs, vulnerability.","[{'name': 'Rwanda', 'abbreviation': 'RWA'}]",,"[{'topic': 'Food security'}, {'topic': 'Protection'}, {'topic': 'Community Services'}, {'topic': 'Livelihood and Social cohesion'}, {'topic': 'Income Generation'}, {'topic': 'Water Sanitation Hygiene'}, {'topic': 'Cash Assistance'}]","[{'start': '2021-09-07', 'end': '2021-09-20'}]","In line with the sampling strategy of the first JPDM in December 2020, the second JPDM aimed to provide statistically representative data and analysis on camp level for all six camps in Rwanda.
  In addition, to better understand the vulnerability status of households receiving various assistance since the targeting started, the sampling of the 2nd JPDM was also designed to be representative at the assistance group level. Same as the first JPDM, the assessment team used the total number of ProGres Groups by the time the survey was designed (August 2021) as the most reliable proxy to the total number of households, hence the sample frame. The sample size was planned to reach (a minimum of) 2,400 households in total with 95% confidence level and 5% margin error while factoring a 15% non-response rate. The distribution of the households by camp and by eligibility group was proportional to the distribution of number of the total population in each stratification.
  a household panel study
A panel component was incorporated in the 2nd JPDM. By sampling the households who were surveyed in the December’s 2020 JPDM and comparing their performances in key outcome indicators through a longitudinal analysis over a period of 5 months (May 2021 – September 2021). The assessment sheds light on the effectiveness of the targeting as other factors that may confound the interpretation of targeting impact such as refugees mobility, are controlled. 
  Among the sampled households of December 2020, those who remain registered/trackable in the camp and at the same time, have held the same eligibility group status since targeting started were sampled for the survey. In other words, among the total sample, the panel households were interviewed and the additional number of households needed to reach the overall sample plan was added from random sampling from ProGres",Face-to-face [f2f],,,Weights have been calculated as the total households per group per location/selected households per target group per location,"[{'name': 'WFP, UNHCR'}]","UNHCR, WFP (2021).

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

In 2020, an estimated 2.5 million people were internally displaced and close to 400,000 Darfuris refugees resided in neighbouring countries. The political transition following years of conflict paved the way for the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) in 2020. The peace agreement aims to address the root causes of conflict but also establishes durable solutions for displaced populations as a necessity for lasting peace in Darfur. In 2021, the Government furthermore initiated work on a National Strategy on Solutions, which will offer a critical strategic framework and operational roadmap towards solutions for displaced communities in Sudan. 
In 2017, the Government of Sudan (GoS) and the international community agreed on the need to collectively support Durable Solutions for IDPs, returnees, and their host communities to end the situation of protracted displacement. The collaboration on Durable Solutions between the GoS and international community resulted in two Durable Solution pilots in respectively El Fasher (North Darfur) and Um Dukhun (Central Darfur). JIPS provided technical support for the scale-up of the durable solutions analysis across Darfur under the Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF). 
Focusing on nine localities, including urban areas, the data collection exercises build directly on the durable solutions analysis approach piloted in El Fasher in 2019. The Durable Solutions Working Group (DSWG) identified a joint evidence base and a collaborative approach as priorities and therefore undertook a joint area-based profiling exercise, focusing on the Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps on the outskirts of El Fasher. 
The focus was set on profiling of IDPs (in camp settlements and out of camps), IDP returnees, refugee returnees, and non-displaced. The profiling exercises are aimed at: 
i.Informing CERF programming and Action Plan development in each state/locality;

Tajikistan hosts the largest number of refugees in Central Asia, predominantly from neighbouring Afghanistan. While some progress has been achieved in areas such as access to health and education for refugees, livelihoods and self-reliance, though, continue to pose a challenge. As the result of Covid-19, refugees faced a myriad of challenges, including the loss of daily incomes and livelihoods to cover basic needs such as rent, food and health care. For refugees in Tajikistan, who largely rely on daily work, the impact of Covid 19 has been devastating as it has led to widespread unemployment. As a response measure, UNHCR jointly with its NGO partner provided Covid-19 cash assistance to 414 refugee households over the course of six months (July-December 2020). The results from this survey suggest that cash assistance provided as an immediate measure to support vulnerable refugee households during the Covid-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the lives of the respondents. Cash assistance predominantly has been spent to cover food, medicines and rent costs.  

UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.","The survey is conducted in Bokhtar, Dushanbe, J.

5. Expenditure: What did people spend the money on?
6. Outcomes: What changes is the cash assistance contributing to in POC households?
7. Longer-Term Outcomes: Has the cash assistance helped put POC on the pathway to sustainable solutions?

Following an in-depth needs assessment, UNHCR provided the cash assistance via mobile money to over 1,500 women at risk and GBV survivors. Each woman received approximately US $46 a month for eight months, in addition to a cellular phone and financial literacy training.
  This data is the result of a household survey used to measure the results of the programme.

Most refugees in Kenya live in camps located in the impoverished counties of Turkana (40 percent) and Garissa (44 percent), while 16 percent inhabit urban areas—mainly in Nairobi but also in Mombasa and Nakuru.
Refugees in Kenya are not systematically included in national surveys, creating a lack of comparable socioeconomic data on camp-based and urban refugees, and their hosts. As the third of a series of surveys focusing on closing this gap, this Socioeconomic Survey of Urban Refugees's aim is to understand the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees in Kenya, especially in the face of ongoing conflicts, environmental
hazards, and others shocks, as well as the recent government announcement to close Kenya’s refugee camps, which highlights the potential move of refugees from camps into urban settings
The SESs are representative of urban refugees and camp-based refugees in Turkana County. For the Kalobeyei 2018 and Urban 2020–21 SESs, households were randomly selected from the UNHCR registration database (proGres), while a complete list of dwellings,
obtained from UNHCR’s dwelling mapping exercise, was used to draw the sample for the Kakuma 2019 SES. The Kalobeyei SES and Kakuma SES were done via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the Urban SES
was collected via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). The Kalobeyei SES covers 6,004 households; the Kakuma SES covers 2,127 households; and the Urban SES covers 2,438 households in Nairobi, Nakuru, and Mombasa. 
Questionnaires are aligned with national household survey instruments, while additional modules are added to explore refugee-specific dynamics. The SES includes modules on demographics, household characteristics, assets, employment, education, consumption, and expenditure, which are aligned with the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2015–16 and the recent Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS) 2019. 
Additional modules on access to services, vulnerabilities, social cohesion, mechanisms for coping with lack of food, displacement trajectories, and durable solutions are administered to capture refugee-specific challenges.","Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru",Households and individuals,"All refugees registered with UNHCR via ProGres, verified via the Verification Exercise conducted in 2021",Sample survey data [ssd],"Household: Demographics, livelihoods, land and farming, food security, housing, access to services (health, water, sanitation, education), participation in public events, safety and security, conflict resolution, social cohesion and inter-group relations, perception about displaced population, intentions.

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the survey data was collected via telephone. Hence, the survey is representative of households with active phone numbers registered by UNHCR in urban Kenya – Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru.  A sample size of 2,500 was needed to ensure a margin of error of less than 5 percent at a confidence level of 95 percent for groups represented by at least 50 percent of the population. 
  The sample for the urban SES is designed to estimate socioeconomic indicators, such as food insecurity, for groups whose share represents at least 50 percent of the population. Considering the total urban refugee population as of August 2020 and the proportions of main countries of origin, as well as a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size is 2,500 households in total, with 1,250 in Nairobi, 700 in Nakuru, and 550 in Mombasa. A total of 2,438 households were reached: 1,300 in Nairobi, 409 in Nakuru, and 729 in Mombasa. 
  The units in ProGres list are UNHCR proGres families, which are different from households as defined in standard household surveys. Upon registration, UNHCR groups individuals into ‘proGres’ families which do not necessarily meet the criteria to be considered a household. A proGres family is usually comprised by no more than one household. In turn, a household can be integrated by one or more proGres families.
Households were selected as the unit of observation to ensure comparability with national household surveys. Households are a set of related or unrelated people (either sharing the same dwelling or not) who pool ration cards and regularly cook and eat together. As proGres families were sampled, the identification of households was done by an introductory section that confirms that each member of the selected proGres family is a member of the household and whether there are other members in the households that belong to other ProGres families. Thus, the introductory section documents the number of proGres families present in the household under observation.
Before selecting the survey strata, the team attempted to better understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phones. From the proGres data, phone penetration in urban areas is high (Nairobi and Mombasa: 93 percent, Nakuru: 95 percent). To understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phone, we looked at socio-economic outcomes for proGres family refugees with access to a phone number and those without",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],,"The mode of data collection limits comparability between refugee and host communities. The Urban SES was conducted through CATI, whereas the KCHS was done through computer-assisted personal interviews. Phone surveys can limit the representativeness of the sample and the external validity of their estimates due to telephone coverage, low participation, and response rates.44 These limitations are a source of bias, which can be reduced by adjusting the survey weights using information from the population data. While the sampling weights for the SES control to some extent for differences in household profiles by phone ownership (households with phone vs. all households), they do not address the differences that might arise between the two modes of data collection. In addition, the training of enumerators and fieldwork might differ between phone surveys and face-to-face surveys.
Hence, comparisons between refugees and hosts are limited. Poverty comparisons are also limited. Since collecting consumption data to estimate poverty can result in long interview times and reduced quality of phone survey data, the Urban SES did not include a consumption module. Therefore, poverty rates are not provided, although they are available through the KCHS for host communities.","The sampling weights were constructed using the outline in Himelein (2014): i) as the first step, the base weight was computed, equal to 1 for all households. Ii) In the second step, we derive the attrition-adjusted weights for all households by modeling a linear logistic model at the household level.  Iii) In the third step, the weights of the previous step are trimmed to correct outlier weights. Iv) As part of post-stratification, weights are scaled to the number of households in each location.","[{'name': 'UNHCR'}, {'name': 'The World Bank'}]","UNHCR, The World Bank (2020).

UNHCR Afghanistan has used cash-based interventions for several years for a wide range of purposes, including voluntary repatriation, basic needs, community-based protection, and livelihoods among others. UNHCR seeks to improve cash programming by regularly and systematically collecting information through post-distribution monitoring (PDM) on several aspects related to UNHCR’s CBIs including efficiency of cash delivery, access to markets, use of cash, unmet needs and coping strategies. Findings are expected to help UNHCR to improve the way the CBIs are designed and delivered.
This PDM covers two CBI programmes delivered by UNHCR in in the Eastern Region of Afghanistan in 2020, cash for protection and cash for shelter. Cash for protection was designed to support households with specific protection profiles to cope with the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and avoid harmful coping strategies. Cash for shelter was designed to support vulnerable households with conditional cash grants to construct safe and dignified shelter. While the programmes were carried out countrywide, supporting 13,792 households with cash for protection and 506 with cash for shelter, the Eastern Region supported the largest number of CBI recipients. As such, this region was prioritized for the PDM data collection which took place in Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

It is a representative survey of the post-2017 population of displaced Rohingya and households in host communities in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh.

The high-frequency phone tracking (HFT) surveys were built to maintain communication with baseline respondents while collecting rapid data on key welfare indicators on labor, basic needs and education. Three rounds of the HFT have been completed between 2020-2021, which have been used to produce welfare updates on the host and Rohingya population residing in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, particularly amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

The surveys collect standard indicators across both Rohingya and host populations. However, it should be noted that camps operate under different policy regulations compared to hosts, and as such, indicators and findings, for all three dimensions, are not directly comparable. 

Labor: The baseline survey administered the labor module on 2-3 randomly selected adults in the household. For the tracking survey, any one of the 2-3 adults who had completed the baseline survey were interviewed in a given tracking round. Weights were re-adjusted in each of the tracking rounds to ensure comparability with baseline population characteristics.

Access to basic needs: The basic needs modules across the rounds have collected information on a variety of topics ranging from a household's ability to have purchased basic food items, difficulties faced in obtaining said items, access to health services, consumption patterns and credit seeking behavior. All data collected is at household level.

Education: The education module was introduced in R2 and has collected information on educational engagement of school-aged children (all 3-18 years old at baseline 2019) amidst COVID-19. Note that the modules ask about any engagement in educational activities and not about school enrolment in context of COVID-19 school closures, thus comparisons with baseline figures should be approached carefully.

Note that Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards. 

Please refer to the published briefs for details on how the indicators and findings should be inferred. Briefs are available here: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bangladesh/brief/cox-s-bazar-panel-survey-briefs","[{'name': 'Bangladesh', 'abbreviation': 'BGD'}]",,,"[{'start': '2020-04', 'end': '2020-05', 'cycle': 'Round 1'}, {'start': '2020-10', 'end': '2020-12', 'cycle': 'Round 2'}, {'start': '2021-04', 'end': '2021-05', 'cycle': 'Round 3'}]","The CBPS study has a total sample size of 5,020 households (HHs), divided among three strata covering Rohingya refugees in camps and host communities in Cox’s Bazar district and some adjacent regions of Bandarban district. The CBPS HFT attempted to follow the full baseline sample of 5,020 household in each round, with no alterations or additions made to the sampling design. The baseline sampling strategy is detailed below. 
The three strata are defined as:  
i. Rohingya refugees in camps 
ii. High exposure hosts: hosts within 15 km (3-hour walking distance) of camps
iii. Low exposure hosts: hosts at more than 15 km (3-hour walking distance) from camps
(In the datasets, the 'settlement_type' and 'stratum' variables identify the different levels at which the sample is representative)

Defining the camp strata: A two-step data collection on Rohingya refugee prevalence within host communities (i.e., outside of camps) confirmed that prevalence in host communities was low, and that this was the case not only for newer Rohingya displaced, but for the older cohort of displaced, as well. This pattern of refugee prevalence supported having one stratum for the Rohingya displaced living in camps. The sampling strategy for the CBPS therefore focused on generating representative estimates for the camp based Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar district.

Defining the host strata: For hosts, the sampling strategy was designed to account for the differential implications of a camp-based concentration of close to a million Rohingya displaced for different areas of Cox’s Bazar. To distinguish between host communities that are differentially affected by the arrival of the Rohingya, the CBPS sampling strategy used a threshold of three hours’ walking time from a campsite to define two survey strata: (i) host communities with potentially high exposure (HE) to the displaced Rohingya, and (ii) host communities with potentially low exposure (LE).

Sampling frame: The camp sample uses the Needs and Population Monitoring Round 12 (NPM12) data from the International Organization for Migration as the sampling frame. For the host sample, a combination of the 2011 population census, Admin 4 shapefiles from the Bureau of Statistics and publicly available Google Earth imagery and OpenStreetMaps were used to develop a sampling frame.

Stages of sample selection: For camps, NPM12 divided all camps into 1,954 majhee blocks.1 200 blocks were randomly selected using a probability proportional to the size of the camp. A full listing was carried out in each selected camp block.

For hosts, a two-stage sampling strategy was followed. The first stage of selection was done at the mauza level by strata. A random sample of 66 mauzas was drawn from a frame of 286 mauzas using probability proportional to size. Based on census population size, each mauza was divided into segments of roughly 100-150 households. The second stage selected three segments from each selected mauza with equal probability of selection.

Listing and replacements: Within each selected PSU in camps (blocks) and hosts (mauza-segments), all households (100-150 on average) were listed. Of listed households, 13 households were selected at random for interview, with an additional replacement list of 5 households. 
More information on the sampling strategy and process can be found on the published working paper titled “Data Triangulation Strategies to Design a Representative Household Survey of Hosts and Rohingya Displaced in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh”.",['Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi]'],"The R1 tracking questionnaire was developed as a lean version of the questionnaire implemented during the CBPS baseline. The R2 and R3 questionnaires retained certain aspects of the R1 questionnaire, but also added more detailed questions on aspects such as food security (in consultation with UN-WFP) and credit-seeking and coping behavior based on findings observed in previous rounds and dynamic research needs within the COVID-19 crisis.

One questionnaire was developed per round of data collection with modules containing household level questions on access to basic needs, credit-seeking behavior, access to health services, vaccinations and individual level questions on labor market status. Any adult, knowledgeable member of the confirmed sample household were eligible to answer the household modules. The labor module was only permitted if the respondent reached was any one of the 2-3 selected adults within the household who had completed the baseline adult questionnaires.

Questionnaires were developed in English and translated into Bengali. The translations to Bengali were thoroughly reviewed by the World Bank team’s local consultants to ensure quality. Pretesting and piloting were done using the Bengali questionnaires.

All questionnaires and modules in English are provided as external resources.","Each round was preceded by 1-month of preparatory activities including a 10-14 days training of enumerators and supervisors. Enumerators were trained on administering the survey questions appropriately, basic survey etiquette and usage of the CATI software. The trainings were followed by one week of mock pretesting and piloting.

A team of 20 enumerators and 3 supervisors were used in each round for data collection, with maximum effort made to retain the same team in every round. Interviews with camp respondents were conducted in the Rohingya/Chittagonian dialect, and interviews in host communities were conducted in either Bengali or the Chittagonian dialect contingent upon the respondent’s preference.

Each interview took on average 25-30 minutes to complete. The team initially faced significant network-related difficulties in conducting phone interviews in camps due to government regulations on mobile network operations in the regions inside and in immediate vicinity of camps. These network-related technical difficulties were addressed through call-backs at different times of day, and if needed across the week.","There are three types of weights in the CBPS baseline datasets. In what follows, the “level” of a dataset refers to what each observation in the data set represents i.e. a household, an individual, an occupation of an individual, etc. In general, the appropriate weight to be used is based on the unit of sampling: i.e. HH weights should be used for data collected at the level of the household (i.e. the household survey); and AA weights should be used for data collected at the level of individual adults i.e. the adult survey).

The two types of baseline weights – household weight and adult weight – have been readjusted for each tracking round based on the response rate. The respective tracking round weights are available on each dataset. Labor datasets contain aa_weight_r# and the basic needs datasets contain hh_weight_r#. The education datasets do not contain weights variable as individual roster member weights were not created during the baseline. It is expected that education outcomes will be analyzed at the household level using the hh_weight_r# weights.",,"Krishnan, Nandini; Khan, Afsana; Haque, Arshia; Tillan, Pablo; Endara, Joaquin, 2020, Cox's Bazar Panel Survey High Frequency Phone Tracking Surveys Rounds 1,2,3 (CBPS HFT'20-21), [URL], World Bank, V1",,"Data was collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews via SurveyCTO, an ODK-based platform.

In addition to logic checks within the survey program itself, extensive data consistency checks and quality indicators were developed by the WB team to monitor data quality during survey implementation. Field debriefs were held frequently during the piloting phase and first week of data collection, and once a week in latter weeks to provide feedback to enumerators and gain clarity on data quality concerns.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

UNHCR led the socio economic impact assessment for refugee population in India. The assessment was conducted in collaboration with UNICEF and in partnership with BOSCO.

 
As of June 2020, 40,068 refugees and asylum seekers from different nationalities are registered with UNHCR in India (28,053 refugees and 12,015 asylum seekers). Approximately 51% of the population registered with UNHCR lives in Delhi NCR, the remaining population live throughout the country, with bigger groups in Hyderabad, Jammu and Mewat. Rohingya are the largest group of persons of concern to UNHCR in India with 17,772 persons, followed by Afghans (15,806 persons). Of the total population registered with UNHCR, 47% are women and girls while 16% are persons with specific needs. 

 
The survival mechanism for most of the refugees and asylum seekers is mainly based on a daily income that is immensely challenged with the ongoing lockdown and restriction of movement introduced by the central and state governments. These restrictions make it impossible for asylum seekers and refugees to reach the location of their informal employment or daily income generating activities, or to receive customers for their goods and services.

The economic downturn, steep inflation, COVID-19 and finally the Beirut blast have pushed vulnerable communities in Lebanon - including Syrian refugees - to the brink, with thousands of families sinking further into poverty. 
The Government of Lebanon (GoL) estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million1 of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the conflict since 2011 (including 879,529 registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2020 ). The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentration of refugees per capita in the world. 
The 2020 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) was the eighth annual survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Given the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon, most assessments and other activities requiring in person visits were either cancelled or postponed. Considering the prolonged socio-economic status in Lebanon and COVID-19, it was crucial to provide needs-based estimates on Syrian refugees in the country. Thus, the VASyR 2020 was one of the few assessments that were conducted face-to-face; the implementation was accompanied by a comprehensive protocol to ensure the safety of families and field workers. The criticality of conducting the VASyR 2020 was to provide insights about Syrian refugees impacted by the political and economic crisis that hit Lebanon in late 2019 and by the COVID-19 outbreak.",National coverage,Household and individual,,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

UNHCR database of known Syrian refugees as of June 2020 served as the sample frame. Cases with missing addresses were excluded. Sampling was based on a ""30 x 7"" two-stage cluster scheme initially developed by the World Health Organization. This method outlines a sample size of 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster which provides a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. Districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure similar representativeness with other governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each, yielding 90 cluster selections for each. The governorate of Baalbek Hermel is made up of only two districts, as such, and to ensure an adequate sample in that governorate, one additional cluster sample was considered.

The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family/household) under UNHCR databases. Using Emergency Nutrition Assesment (ENA) software, villages were selected using probability proportionate to size where villages with a larger concentration of refugees was more likely to be selected and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters, per district. 

In order to estimate the sample size needed to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level, the following assumptions were used: 
- 50% estimated prevalence
- 10% precision
- 1.5 design effect 
- 5% margin of error

Using the above parameters, 165 cases per district/cluster selection was required, leading to a target of 5,115 cases nationally. Due to the known high level of mobility of the Syrian refugee population and based on experience in previous rounds of VASyR and other household level surveys, a 40% non-response rate was considered.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The 2020 VASyR questionnaire consisted of around 580 questions that collected data at the household level and individual level including demographics, legal documentation, safety and security, shelter, WASH, health, food security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, debt, coping strategies and assistance, as well as questions specifically relating to women, children and people with disabilities.","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enumerator training took place remotely. Separate enumerator trainings were carried out online for each operational region (Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, North and South) covering the data collection tool, contextual background, methodology and ethical considerations. Additionally, enumerators were required to attend a two-hour online COVID-19 training, provided by the Lebanese Red Cross, which covered key information about the virus, transmission and precautionary methods. Data was collected and entered on electronic tablets by the enumerators during the interviews using KoBo toolbox software.","Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district. Weighting was necessary to ensure that the geographical distribution of the population was reflected in the analysis and to compensate for the unequal probabilities of a household being included in the sample.

UNCHR Pakistan has always been at the front line of dealing with the Afghan refugee crisis. In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and its far lasting financial impacts, UNHCR Pakistan has rolled out an Emergency Cash Assistance Program to help refugees meet their basic needs and to mitigate harsh socio-economic impacts in the time of crises and countrywide lockdowns. UNHCR implemented a one-off emergency cash assistance to vulnerable refugee and asylum seeker families to help meet their basic needs including food, rent, and access to essential supplies and services. This large-scale cash distribution required an independent third-party post distribution monitoring (PDM) to confirm whether the beneficiaries have received their entitled cash payment and also to clarify the mode of utilization of cash, whether it has been shared, spent, or saved.  

UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.","The majority of the respondents were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, followed by Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab.",Households,The total population spans all beneficiaries of Cash-Based Interventions.,Sample survey data [ssd],"The household survey covers the following sections:

The sample size was calculated based on the total number of refugee groups (as the proxy to the total number of households) registered in UNHCR ProGres database as of November 2020. 

Systematic random sampling with a fixed periodic interval was conducted in each camps to select the households.
An alternative list of households was prepared before going to the field. The enumerators visited the households on this list if the interview with the originally sampled households could not be undertaken with justified reasons. 
At the household level, in principle, either the household head or spouse (in the absence of the head) or any adult member of the household (in the absence of both the household head and the spouse) were interviewed. Enumerator did not exclude the child-headed households if  sampled.

Such joint efforts proved effective in enhancing the quality and efficiency of the training. Improvements to the tools and survey implementation were made during training sessions and pilot surveys. Training and discussion were conducted in local language which created certain communication barriers for the Hub to identify discussion that may need intervention timely. 

Following the pilot survey on December 4, the data collection was jointly conducted by WFP and UNHCR between December 5-14, 2020. To ensure participation in the assessment, field sensitization was conducted by the Hub and country teams, which also included Joint Country coordinator's briefing with the camp managers in 3 of 5 camps.

The sampling followed a stratified multi-stage sampling approach in which villages were the primary sampling unit (PSU) and households were the secondary sampling unit (SSU), while stratification was done by target group. Accordingly, the first sampling stage consisted of selecting a sample of villages with probabilities that were proportional to size; villages with higher numbers of households had a higher probability of being selected for the survey. A random sample of households was then selected based on two approaches: systematic skips or systematic snowballing. This depended on the spatial distribution of the target groups in each
village. For example, in all camps and return villages where only IDPs reside, systematic skips were done. In villages with more target groups, systematic snowballing was performed for each target group.

Sampling limitations & specifications
- The sampling is designed to produce results representative for each target group in the locality. Analysis at the village level is not possible and therefore no reference to villages or breakdown by villages is done in the report.
- The locations targeted for the survey were not selected randomly across the localities and thus do not necessarily provide representative results of all settlement situations in the localities. The targeting of location has been based on a conflict sensitive approach and the programmatic scope of the PBF. However, the area level analysis has looked at locality as a whole and thus ounterbalance the survey scope which focused on the displaced target groups.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,,,,"[{'name': 'IOM', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","PBF Sudan, DSWG Sudan, UNHCR, JIPS (2021).

In Ukraine, UNHCR provides individual protection assistance in the following regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Zakarpattya (also covers Lviv) and Kharkiv regions. The UNHCR Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) support only vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers. The type of assistance vary depending on the needs and vulnerability of persons of concern.

- Modality: voucher (Metro cards, a supermarket chain that partners with UNHCR)
- Available only in Kyiv and Odesa 
- Description: Distribution of vouchers (Metro cards) for food and non-food items to refugees and asylum-seekers who meet established vulnerability criteria (newcomers, PoCs in need of supplementary food or hygiene due to medical condition). In 2020, 121 families residing in Kyiv and Odesa received voucher assistance at least once. 

In 2020 UNHCR used Metro Cash&Carry (big supermarket chain) cards in the value of 500 UAH. However, due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions imposed by the government of Ukraine, UNHCR Ukraine has gradually shifted to provision of these types of assistance through other modalities. This PDM focused only on the cases processed through vouchers.

- Modality: cash. OTC (over the counter) 
- Available in Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv 
Description: MSA (monthly subsistence allowance) aims to support the most vulnerable persons of concern. It is given based on the strict vulnerability criteria and cases are reviewed every four months at the MSA committee meetings, composed of partner social counselors, SMS and UNHCR. In 2020, 105 vulnerable families were covered by this type of support. 

The amount of MSA is calculated based on the family size. It is in line with the recommendations of the Cash Working Group on assistance provision at 60% of subsistence level (3 774.62 UAH as of February 2020), which corresponds to MSA amount.

Lastly, the JNA was to inform programmatic decisions and suggest the most appropriate and feasible targeting approach for future interventions by WFP and UNHCR.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Year after year, there has been an increase in individuals fleeing. This was marked initially by especially large numbers of unaccompanied children, then joined in around 2018 with dramatic increases in families units fleeing Central America. Families are forced to flee together as violent threats and persecution by criminal groups in communities extend beyond individuals to entire family units. 

Given these shifting dynamics in human mobility in these countries, UNHCR and UNICEF, through the Interdisciplinary Development Consultants, CID Gallup, decided to undertake this study with the aim of understanding and giving visibility to the forced displacement of families that flee northern Central America. In addition, the study also seeks to shed light on the current trends, protection risks and factors associated to the forced displacement and migration of unaccompanied and separated children.

For this purpose, Gallup conducted 3,104 surveys, complemented by focus group sessions segmented according to the geography of displacement in the region: country of origin, of transit and of asylum.

The content of each survey was focused on the following profiles:  

Families and children and adolescents at risk of displacement in countries of origin: a total of 789 surveys were carried out with families identified from a non-probabilistic sampling. The surveys were taken in areas with the highest criminality and violence rates in countries of origin (El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala), which were also areas with a prior history of forced displacement identified through previous studies. The survey questions focused on risks faced by families in their places of origin, including those that would compel them to flee, particularly those related to violence and poverty.

Families and children and adolescents in transit: a total of 836 surveys were carried out with families identified from a non-probabilistic sampling. The surveys were taken at locations where persons in transit were typically found in Guatemala and Mexico, such as Casas de Migrantes. For the quantitative component, data of unaccompanied children and adolescents was gatheredin Casa Nuestras Raices in Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango. This segment of the population was surveyed on the risks they faced during transit as well as the causes of displacement from their countries of origin.

Families and children and adolescents in country of destination: through non-probabilistic sampling methods, 453 people were surveyed, the majority of whom were recognized as refugees or asylum seekers in Mexico. Several interviews were facilitated by the UNHCR Office in Mexico in areas with this population profile: Casa del Migrante Monsenor-Oluta Veracruz, Scalabrinianas Mision con Migrantes y Refugiados, State DIF, Municipal DIF, among others. The survey questions for this population focused on the asylum procedure and their living conditions in the country.

Deported families and children and adolescents: non-probability cluster sampling. Interviews were conducted with 1,026 families that had been detained and deported during the 12 months prior to the survey.

In November 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in the delivery of multi-purpose cash (MPC) to assist the most economically vulnerable Syrian refugee households to meet their basic needs. 

This study aims to measure the short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) causal impact of the $173.50 and $175 MPC assistance provided by WFP and UNHCR respectively, over and above the $27 per person per month assistance, as well as the impact of discontinuation from MPC on the well-being of Syrian refugees. This report presents the causal impact on multiple dimensions of well-being, namely household expenditures, food security, housing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, employment, health and decision-making. 

The key take-away messages from the study are: 
1. The impact of MPC materialised across most dimensions of well-being in the long-term, indicating the importance of households' access to a longer duration of MPC.
2. The benefits of MPC fade for many indicators within 4 to 10 months after discontinuation, and households' well-being returned to pre-assistance levels for most indicators, and dropped slightly below the pre-assistance baseline for others. 
3. The findings would suggest that there are benefits to instituting longer cash cycles and/or linking MPC to other services through a 'cash plus' approach to expand and extend the positive impact of cash on beneficiary households and ensure sustainable impact. 

A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date.",,Household and individual.,,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

The impact evaluation used a quasi-experimental fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which enables estimation of the causal impact of MPC after different enrolment periods in the programme (rather than producing simple correlations). For this purpose, a multi-sectoral household survey was collected across three regions in Lebanon (Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon), where 85 per cent of Syrian refugees and 94 per cent of MPC beneficiaries live, over three waves of data collection held in July/ August 2018, February/March 2019, and July/August 2019. The multiple rounds of data collection allowed for the measurement of effects that materialise at different points in time and enabled the validation of the detected impact. Furthermore, collecting data in the summer and winter made it possible to account for seasonal variations, and accessing administrative data from UNHCR on other assistance programmes targeting the population of interest made it possible to append this information and distinguish between the effect of MPC and other programmes. WFP and UNHCR cash assistance beneficiaries are selected based on a proxy means testing formula that constructs a vulnerability score for each household based on a set of socio-demographic characteristics from the UNHCR database. This score predicts the per capita expenditure level of households and is used to rank them from most to least vulnerable. All households with a score below the SMEB are eligible for MPC. However, due to budgetary constraints, only about 29 per cent of eligible households currently receive the MPC package. WFP follows a bottom-up approach by including in the programme households starting from the lowest scores and moving up the scores until the allocated funding is fully disbursed. UNHCR employs a geographical bottomup targeting approach by including the most vulnerable households in each geographic region until it reaches the regions allocated proportion given its budget constraints. Accordingly, the point at which the funding is fully disbursed creates an artificial cut-off line. This creates a quasi-natural experiment where households on either side of the cut-off are plausibly similar along observable and unobservable characteristics. As a result, the argument is that the only difference is the receipt of MPC. Thus, any differences in outcomes between households are attributable to the amount of cash assistance received, which allows for measuring the causal impact of the MPC. Notably, because the annual recalibration of the targeting formula that determines a households eligibility for MPC occurred prior to the collection of wave 2 data, this uniquely positioned the study to measure the impact of discontinuation on affected household.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaire included the following sections: demographics, education, employment, health, food, housing, economic situation, accountability.",,,"[{'name': 'Economic Development Solutions', 'abbreviation': 'EDS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Please cite as follows:

The survey objectives required that – in addition to primary stratification by cohort – the sample of households (i.e., PAs) be stratified at least by year of entry and geographic region of origin.
The 2019 ASR employed a stratified probability sample design of refugees. The first stage of selection was the household (PA) and the second stage was the selection of persons within households. Within each of the three cohort strata, the following factors were used for stratification:
cohort, year of arrival (for cohorts 1 and 2 only); geographic region, native language, age group, gender, and family size at arrival (1, 2, 3+ persons). Proportionate stratified samples were drawn independently within cohort.
A replicated sample design was used for the 2019 ASR. A larger sample of 10,800 was drawn and randomly split into equal sized replicates to produce 30 independent sample replicates per cohort. Under this strategy, 20 replicates comprised the 7,200 that were expected to be needed based on the assumptions of tracing and nonparticipation used above. Upon commencement of field operations, 10 of the 30 replicates for each cohort were released into the field and the results monitored by cohort, thus releasing about 3,600 sampled PAs",Telephone interview,,"For the ASR 2019, revisions to the 2018 survey instruments and materials were made on
the English version and then translated into 19 non-English languages. Additionally, the
survey retained an interpreter to conduct interviews in a 21st language, Chaldean.","Household- and person-level analytic weights were developed for the 2016 ASR to allow for valid statistical estimates of the target refugee population.  Both sets of weights are comprised of two components – a base weight reflecting the selection probability and an adjustment that corrects for differential nonresponse and aligns the population to known totals from the sampling frame (RADS universe file). 
The household analytic weight was formed by taking the product of the base weight and post-stratification adjustment. The post-stratification adjustment was created by applying an iterative proportional fitting algorithm called “raking” to the ASR household-level respondent data that simultaneously align the sample to the refugee population distributions for several factors from the RADS data.","[{'name': 'Urban Institute (contracted by ORR)', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","Urban Institute. 2019 Annual Survey of Refugees.

The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

There are over 2.2 million refugees spread across Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Central African Republic (CAR) a further 1.8 million people are displaced internally in South Sudan. An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population. The Revitalised Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) foresees the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) with all the parties in agreement including the leader of the SPLA IO and first vice president by May 2019.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

The Intention Survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted among the over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees living in six countries of asylum using a stratified random sampling approach to survey 6,964 refugees (heads of households) in 15 camps selected across the region. In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household. The confidence intervals were taken into consideration in all the tables and analysis. Security, access and logistical constraints restricted sampling in some locations, therefore weighting was applied to adjust for unequal selection probabilities in each of the 15 locations. The findings of this report are representative of the return intentions of refugee households in these 15 camps. Data was collected through in-person interviews using a harmonised survey that was conducted concurrently in the six countries in May 2019 with a mobile data collection tool (KoBo Toolkit).

Most of the newly-arrived refugees have settled in hilly, formerly-forested areas that are vulnerable to landslides and flash-flooding in monsoon season and rely heavily on humanitarian assistance to cover their basic needs.

This number was determined through simple calculations based on the most current data available from the UNHCR (15 March 2019) at the time of data collection preparation. The target sample was 1,300 new adult Rohingya. The data provided by the UNHCR allowed the researchers to establish the population and gender distribution for each refugee camp, and thus choose the number of respondents to include in the survey from each camp proportionately. Each subgroup within the target population received representation within the sample and no subpopulation was overrepresented in the results

Out of a total of 1,455 surveys conducted, 1,277 were deemed sufficient for further analysis. The sample of 1,277 respondents can be considered broadly representative of the total adult, new Rohingya population residing in the selected refugee camps across Cox’s Bazar district

The enumerators were given instructions to select respondents randomly in the chosen camps which was not always possible for several reasons. Hence, even though the sample can be considered representative of the population under study, the potential for selection bias cannot be excluded.

The enumerators, as Rohingya refugees themselves and fluent in Rohingya, could clarify questions posed by the respondents. However, the questions and the responses were translated from English to Rohingya and from Rohingya to English respectively by each enumerator on the spot. This might have resulted in misinterpretations and/or negatively influenced the accuracy of some responses.

Prior to data collection, a pilot test of the research instrument was conducted in Shamlapur (Camp 23). Minor changes were made to the questionnaire to facilitate the respondents’ understanding and reduce any potential response bias.

Each enumerator interviewed an average of 17 people each day, whilst maintaining constant remote communication with the Xchange research team and receiving guidance from a local facilitator on the ground. All surveys were conducted in person and in a secluded area to ensure privacy, when feasible. The principle of anonymity was explained to all respondents and verbal consent was ensured before proceeding with the survey.

To establish a high level of rapport between interviewers and interviewees and ensure the information received was as unbiased as possible, the female enumerator interviewed only women.

This study aims to provide a representative overview of the profiles of Venezuelan asylum seekers and migrants living in different geographic locations and shelter settings in Brazil, for the purpose of increasing the understanding of humanitarian actors as to the extent to which the living conditions, needs, and vulnerabilities of Venezuelan households vary between households living in abrigos and those living in host communities, across three cities that are relevant nodes in the Brazilian refugee response: Pacaraima, Boa Vista, and Manaus.  The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. Of all services, Venezuelans seem to face the most challenges regarding access to education; findings suggest that a lack of required documents and a limited local capacity are constraining the enrolment of Venezuelan children into local schools. These two factors were also the most likely to pose barriers to accessing social services and healthcare facilities. Difficulties in speaking the local language and long distances to facilities were found to further constrain households' access to services, albeit to a lesser extent.","Pacaraima, Boa Vista, and Manaus.",Household,Households living in shelters.,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

Water points and latrines are well-lit and close to homes so that girls and women, especially, will not be exposed to danger. All these arrangements are as well done to prevent the spread of hygiene and sanitation-related diseases in camps. To monitor this important situation the UNHCR regularly organizes Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Knowledge, Aptitude, Practises (KAP) surveys that monitor the WASH indicators.",BAGA SOLA/Tchad,Household,Refugees living in Camps and settlements in the area of BAGA SOLA,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites (about 40% of the total refugees in Kenya), and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey replicates the preceding Kalobeyei SES (2018), designed to address these shortcomings and support the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Most of them were Shona, descendants of missionaries who arrived from Zimbabwe and Zambia in the 1960s and remained in Kenya. The total number of Shona living in Kenya is estimated to be between 3,000 and 3,500 people. 
On their first arrival, the Shona were issued certificates of registration, but a change in the Registration of Persons Act of 1978 did not make provision for people of non-Kenyan descent, consequently denying the Shona citizenship. Zimbabwe and Zambia did not consider them nationals either, rendering them stateless. Besides the Shona, there are other groups of stateless persons of different origins and ethnicities, with the total number of stateless persons in Kenya estimated at 18,500.
UNHCR and the Government of Kenya are taking steps to address statelessness in the country, among them is the registration of selected groups for nationalization. In April 2019, the Government of Kenya pledged to recognize qualifying members of the Shona community as Kenyan citizens. However, the lack of detailed information on the stateless population in Kenya hinders advocacy for the regularization of their nationality status. Together with the Kenyan Government through the Department of Immigration Services (DIS) and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), UNHCR Kenya conducted registration and socioeconomic survey for the Shona community from May to July 2019. While the primary objective of the registration was to document migration, residence and family history with the aim of preparing their registration as citizens, this survey was conducted to provide a baseline on the socio-economic situation of the stateless Shona population for comparison with non-stateless populations of Kenya.","Githurai, Nairobi, Kiambaa and Kinoo",Household and individual,"All Shona living in Nairobi and Kiambu counties, Kenya",Census/enumeration data [cen],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and forthcoming Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS).

The inclusive criteria of the survey allowed the enumerators to collect data from household heads or any household member of age 18 years and above who consented to participate in the survey. Qualitative methods mainly KIIs were also adopted in order to gather an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the various primary targets of the programme. These included households, members of WASH Committees, NRC staff and staff from the implementing partner agencies. Observation method was also used during the survey to assess WASH infrastructure and human habits. The infrastructure included; water points, sanitation and hygiene facilities.

UNHCR conducted an annual SENS nutrition surveys in Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement. 

At the time of the survey, the camp was hosting 186,515 refugees originating from 20 countries, comprised of 53.3% (99,320) males and 46.7% (87,195) females. These represented 148,295 from Kakuma and 38,220 from Kalobeyei and originating from 20 nationalities. The number of children under 5 years of age is currently estimated to be 20,468 from Kakuma and 7,576 from Kalobeyei or 15% of the total population. Women of reproductive age were 32,373 from Kakuma and 7,643 from Kalobeyei. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) HIS database (Nov 2018), the main countries of origin are currently South Sudan, 57.8 %, and Somalia, 33.6 %, with the remaining percent originating from various countries in the region including Democratic republic of Congo (6.5%), Ethiopia (5.6%), and Burundi (5.4%) among others 

Data collection started on the 27th November of 2019 in Kakuma and 8th of December of 2019 in Kalobeyei settlement. The overall aim of this survey was to assess the general nutrition and health status of refugee population and formulate workable recommendations for appropriate nutritional and public health interventions.","Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement in Turkana County, Kenya","Children 0-23 months

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last. If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. 2019 SENS HH1). The numbering and labelling was done two days prior to commencement of the survey.

Survey teams visited 4,727 randomly selected Syrian refugee households, covering all districts across Lebanon. The result of the study demonstrates that while some improvements in specific indicators are noted, Syrian refugees in Lebanon continue to show heightened vulnerabilities. While rates of birth registration have seen an increase since previous years, other legal documentation issues (e.g. legal residency) remains to be an on-going challenge.

As such, districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure representativeness of these two districts as governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each.
The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit.

REACH will draft the household survey tool through an iterative consultation process with cluster partners and OCHA and is aligned, as much as possible, with the Joint Inter-Sectoral Analysis Framework (JIAF) which will serve as a common and structured method for assessing the severity of needs across different clusters.

The assessment will use stratified cluster sampling at the district level using settlements as the clusters and households as the unit of measurement. For some districts, 2-stage stratified random sampling will be used instead of stratified cluster sampling for large urban centres, if it proves to be more efficient and logistically feasible for data collection. The sample will be stratified by population group, disaggregated by non-displaced communities, and IDP settlements; the sample will be further stratified by district to ensure coverage and comparison across the entire country (with the exception of inaccessible areas). In the case of cluster sampling, the minimum cluster size will be set to 6 households.

A questionnaire pretest was done with some HHs to ascertain that the enumerators had understood the questionnaires; any issues emerging were addressed. 
Data collection occurred over a period of 18 days. Focus group discussions included both male and female members of AT and Pamir, involving at least 72 people (36 males and 36 females). The collected data was verified on a daily basis prior to data syncing onto the cloud server, and feedback was given to enumerators before beginning data collection the following day.

Maban County is in Upper Nile State in the North East of the Republic of South Sudan (RoSS). The refugee caseload is composed of Sudanese fleeing from the conflict in Blue Nile State in Sudan, residing in four refugee camps; Doro, Yusuf Batil, Gendrassa and Kaya. The overall aim of the survey was to assess the nutrition situation among the refugee population and to monitor ongoing programme interventions.

Systematic random sampling was used to identify the survey respondents. 
Three population groups; children 6-59 months, infants 0-5 months and women of reproductive age 15-49 years were included in the survey. Household level indicators on food security were measured in households whether they included the target population groups or not.

A standardised training lasting four days was provided followed which included a standardisation test. Data collection lasted four days.

The survey teams were supported by a team of 2 supervisors and 2 coordinators who roved between the teams during the data collection.

This household had an ID, even if the survey team could not able to revisit them. The survey team continued with the survey by choosing the next household according to the selection method described above and this household was not replaced. A household was considered “absent” when its members slept there last night and went out for the whole day of the survey.

Refusal
If a participant or an entire household refused to participate then it was considered a refusal and the individual or the household was not replaced with another. The refusal was recorded in the data collection control sheet.

Households without children U5 and/or without women
In households with no children aged 0-59 months and/or women between 15 and 49 years, the survey team had to complete the Demography questionnaire and the Household questionnaire (Food security, mosquito net and WASH) if this household was selected for the Household questionnaire (administered in every other household). In the data collection control sheet, the team leader wrote the household's number and indicated that no children between the ages of 0 and 59 months and/or no women between the ages of 15 and 49 years belonged to the household.

Absent Children/Women
The team leader asked the reason of the children's/women's absence. If the child/woman (or children or women) is close to the home, someone should be sent to bring them back. If the child/woman was expected to return before the survey team leaves the village/cluster, then the survey team had to return before the end of the day to take the measurements. If the child/woman could not be found before the team leaves the village/cluster, the child/woman available information (age, sex, etc.) were recorded in the questionnaire and the child/woman was marked as “absent” in the data collection control sheet.

Disabled Children
Disabled children were included in the survey. If a physical deformity prevents the measurement of child's weight, height or MUAC, the data were recorded as missing and the remaining data were collected. This information was recorded in the data collection control sheet.

Children in a medical/nutrition centre
Children in a medical/nutrition centre were included in the survey. Where feasible, the team had to go to the centre. If it was not possible to visit the centre, the child was given an ID number and considered as absent and not replaced. If the child was too weak to be measured, the anthropometric data were recorded as missing and the remaining data were collected.

The influxes particularly from South Sudan, Burundi and DRC over the past 3 years currently renders Uganda the biggest host for refugees in Africa.

In order to efficiently offer adequate aid to these refugees, more and more humanitarian organizations and international non-governmental organizations have decided to convert in-kind support to cash-based transfers.

Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin.

As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects.

We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The first stage of selection was the household (PA) and the second stage was the selection of persons within households. Principal features of the sample design are highlighted below.

The 2018 ASR design replicated the 2017 and 2016 ASR design, which used a full cross-sectional national sample of refugees entering within the past five years. This section documents the research design, data collection and data processing protocols. It also presents outcomes (e.g., sample sizes) and paradata results such as response rates.

The population of interest – the study population – for the 2018 ASR is defined as refugees entering the U.S. between FY 2013 and FY 2017, inclusive, who are at ages 16 and over at the time of the 2018 ASR interview3. Because the interviews were conducted in early 2019, the population includes a small number of refugee respondents younger than 16 at the time of arrival to the U.S.

The 2018 ASR targeted 1,500 completed interviews from refugee households entering the U.S. between FY 2013-2017. The sample was designed to allow for separate estimates and analyses from each of the three designated cohorts. Moreover, the design needed to accommodate both household- and person-level analyses. 
The sample was drawn as fresh cross sections by cohort; there was no longitudinal component. The survey objectives required that – in addition to primary stratification by cohort – the sample of households (i.e., PAs) be stratified at least by year of entry and geographic region of origin.

The 2018 ASR sampling frame was ORR’s Refugee Arrivals Data System (RADS) dataset.
 
 Within each of the three cohort strata, the following factors were used for stratification: year of arrival (for cohorts 1 and 2 only), geographic region, native language, age group, gender, and family size at arrival (1, 2, 3+ persons). Missing contact information status was also used as a stratification variable for cohort 3 due to an unusual degree of missing contact information among FY 2017 arrivals. Proportionate stratified samples were drawn independently within cohort.",Telephone interview,,"For the 2018 ASR, revisions to the 2017 survey instruments and materials were translated into 16 different languages, including English.

Subsequent demographic questions were asked of respondents first, and repeated for other household members only if their responses were reported to be different (qn1gaa, qn1haa, qn1iaa).","Household- and person-level analytic weights were developed for the 2018 ASR to allow for valid statistical estimates of the target refugee population. Both sets of weights are comprised of two components – a base weight reflecting the selection probability and an adjustment that corrects for differential nonresponse and aligns the population to known totals from the sampling frame (RADS universe file).

Specifically, analytic weights incorporate:

• A base (sampling) weight which reflects the refugee household selection probability. The weight itself is simply the reciprocal of the probability of selection; because the sample allocations of each cohort were managed separately, the selection probabilities varied by the size of the population and the amount of sample released into the field;

• A post-stratification adjustment which corrects the sample for differential nonresponse4 across cohort and demographic subgroups as well as aligning the sample to known population distributions taken from the RADS.","[{'name': 'Urban Institute (contracted by ORR)', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","Urban Institute. 2018 Annual Survey of Refugees.

To address the needs of this growing population staying on the Greek mainland, the Greek Government established Open Reception Facilities (ORFs) in Northern and Central Greece. In the beginning of 2016, UNHCR through its partners established urban accommodation schemes to host asylum seekers eligible for relocation as part of the European solidarity measures. The program evolved to focus on the most vulnerable asylum seekers for whom accommodation in the ORFs was unsuitable. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) set up a similar accommodation program in late 2016 also focusing on the most vulnerable. Arrivals at the Greek-Turkish land border increased in late 2017 and as a result a higher number of people started arriving directly to Thessaloniki, without having presented themselves to the authorities at the border. Hence, they were not registered by the Greek authorities and as a consequence lacked access to a dignified shelter, or other forms of basic assistance available to asylum seekers and refugees. The Municipality of Thessaloniki and the humanitarian community jointly decided to conduct a profiling exercise of the refugees and asylum seekers hosted in Thessaloniki as well as Third Country Nationals not registered with the Asylum Service in Thessaloniki. The objective was to explore the extent to which refugees and asylum seekers were moving towards local integration. This was done by looking at their outlook for the future as well as the obstacles and possibilities towards greater economic and socio-cultural integration in Greece. The analysis of persons with no asylum service documentation focused on the key challenges faced by those groups, such as lack of a regularized status and homelessness. The collected data would form a baseline for future integration monitoring and would additionally be a useful tool for the implementation of integration activities as foreseen in national and local strategies for integration. The survey included a total of 861 households. The survey found out that the great majority of refugees and asylum seekers in the accommodation scheme and in the ORF had been in Thessaloniki less than one year. The majority of the households in the accommodation scheme (60%) reported that they intended to stay in Thessaloniki in the long term, and one of the main conditions for being able to integrate locally is finding employment. Amongst the households in the ORF, less than half intended to stay in Thessaloniki (45%) and more than a third (38%) intended to move to another EU country. For those intending to stay, being able to integrate locally was very much linked to finding a different accommodation solution. The households having found their own accommodation were on average living longer in Thessaloniki, as almost half of them had lived in the city for more than one year compared to other groups who have been living in their majority in their accommodation for less than one year.

The sample was stratified by accommodation type into three strata:
- Those in the urban accommodation scheme who have been provided with apartments
- Those self-accommodated in Thessaloniki, i.e. are either renting an apartment by themselves, or being hosted by friends, relatives or volunteers
- Those who were fully registered residents of the Open Reception Facilities (ORF)
The sampling frame for refugees and asylum seekers was UNHCR's ProGres database, while for the ORF, a site population list provided by the camp manager was used as a basis to generate a sample.A simple random sample of households was initially drawn for the accommodation scheme strata and the self-accommodated strata shortly before the data collection was due to begin. During data collection, reaching a majority of the sampled households was challenging due to the listed phone numbers being outdated, as persons of concern often change their pre-paid SIM cards. Unannounced home visits were not an option given time and resource constraints. It was therefore decided to aim for full coverage of both these strata, expecting that a high proportion of the persons in the ProGres database for these strata would not be reachable by phone. To assess potential bias introduced by this approach, the demographic profile of the surveyed persons was compared to that of the whole population of refugees and asylum seekers in the UNHCR ProGres database. The age and sex figures of the population were compared to the survey figures. The sample distributions resemble the population distributions quite closely on the basis of these demographic characteristics. As such, the overall impression is that there is little skew in the survey data for these two strata. It is therefore assumed that the survey results are representative and can be applied to the population as a whole. For the strata of the Open Reception Facility (ORF), the most update site registration list was obtained from the Reception and Identification Service (RIS) that manages the site. The enumerators managed to get in touch with at least one representative of each of the registered households living in the site at the time of the data collection. No one declined the request for an interview. It was not relevant to compare the surveyed population to the UNHCR database list to assess representativity, given that the population in the site had changed significantly since the list for that strata had been assembled by the camp manager in the site. Since a full count of the site population was achieved, the results are considered to be representative for the population. 
A different sampling took place for third country nationals not registered with the Asylum Service. The unified registry for persons with police notes (EURODAC II) could not be accessed for the purpose of the profiling study. Although organizations that provide assistance to police note holders hold information about this population group, including UNHCR which provides cash assistance, there is no exhaustive list. Similarly there is no unified registry for undocumented persons. However, through comparing aggregated information from multiple service providers, a population figure of 200 households was estimated as a rough baseline. In the absence of a registry, it was not possible to construct a list from which a random sample could be drawn. Thus, a non-probability sampling strategy was applied, which included convenience sampling approaches. With non-probability approaches it is not possible to establish how well the sample represents the population unless all members of a given target group have been interviewed. Convenience sampling is a type of non-probability sampling method, where the sample is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach, e.g. by snowballing techniques where respondents identify other respondents known to them. The enumeration team interviewed 451 persons making up 227 households under the category of third country nationals not registered with the Asylum Service. This number of households interviewed was slightly higher than the number originally foreseen, a possible explanation for this being the aforementioned influx of arrivals to Thessaloniki the same month. The survey results support this theory, as more than half of the survey respondents from this target group had been in Thessaloniki for less than a month at the time of the interview. The high number of recent arrivals made the estimate of the total population more uncertain. In addition, many of the persons who were approached, declined to be interviewed. As a result, it is difficult to assess how representative the interviewees were of the target group.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The survey questionnaire used to collect the data consists of the following sections: Migration history family unity & mobility, Housing, Basic demographics, Education, Employment & work stats, Household economy, Access to health admin social and humanitarian services, Social links and interaction, Future intentions, Social and cultural integration.",The household survey was conducted between the months of April and July 2018 with mobile devices.,"Weight was calculated dividing, for each strata, the population by the sample size.","[{'name': 'United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees', 'abbreviation': 'UNHCR', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Norwegian Refugee Council', 'abbreviation': 'NRC', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Alkyone', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Solidarity Now', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","Cite this data as follows:

The monsoon season began in May and continues into September, threatening the vast majority of refugees living in makeshift shelters and settlements highly vulnerable to floods and landsides.

Translators Without Borders supported in questionnaire translation and enumerator training.  This survey identified a number of areas where the basic needs of Rohingya refugees are being met.  At the same time, this assessment has identified continuing service gaps in the Rohingya response.  For example, the majority of households do not believe there is enough light at night to safely access latrines, and WASH facilities are generally perceived as dangerous areas for girls under age 18. In terms of access to protection services, only a small number of households report members making use of children and women friendly spaces. Despite widespread distribution coverage of key non-food items such as kitchen sets, demand for these items remains high, and refugees are spending the greatest portion of their limited financial resources on basic items including food, clothing and fuel. Findings suggest that there are uncertainties around actions to prepare for cyclones. The mahjis remain almost the sole focal point for communication and complaints with refugees, reflecting their continued prominent position within refugee communities.

Half of the refugees (55%) are children. Within two months of the first arrivals, the number of refugee population in Cox’s Bazar district quadrupled, which made it the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. The refugees continued to arrive by foot and boat in subsequent months. Most of them came with few belongings or cash. UNHCR was among the first humanitarian organisations to respond to the refugee influx with life-saving assistance. Packages of blankets, plastic sheets, sleeping mats, family tents, plastic rolls, kitchen sets, jerry cans and buckets were distributed initially to 250,000 refugees within weeks after their arrival. By end of August 2018, UNHCR distributed 93,803 Core Relief Item (CRI) packages to newly arrived refugee families, each containing tarpaulins, kitchen set, blanket, jerry can, bucket, sleeping mat and solar lamp. At the same time, 90,524 families received Upgrade Shelter Kit (USK) consisting of mulli and borak bamboos, rope, plastic tarpaulins, sandbags and toolkits, to reinforce their shelters for the monsoon season. UNHCR, in close collaboration with partner agencies and other humanitarian actors, continues to support the Government of Bangladesh in responding to the refugee crisis by ensuring relief items are prepositioned and delivered to the most vulnerable refugees and host communities in a timely manner.
UNHCR uses Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugee’s feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilisation and effectiveness of assistance received. It is conducted after the distribution of relief items is completed. A total of 2,298 households were interviewed in this PDM. The PDM survey confirmed that non-food packages distributed by UNHCR and partners met the household needs and minimum quality standard as agreed by the Shelter/NFI Sector in Cox’s Bazar. The overall satisfaction score has improved from the previous survey in March. The refugees reported high satisfaction for the items received, and rated above 4.1 on a 5-point Likert scale for the items quality and usefulness. They also reported general satisfaction with the organisation of NFI distribution, with an average score of 4.0 on the Likert scale. The finding shows that UNHCR and partners are fulfilling their commitment to provide relief items that meet the specific needs of refugees, and that they were distributed in a timely and efficient manner.",Cox's Bazar refugee camps.,Household.,,,"The scope includes:

Presently, there are limits on how self-sufficient refugees can be, as they have restricted freedom of movement beyond the areas where the settlements are and also have no right to work. In addition, there is insufficient land within their settlements to support subsistence farming. As a result, many refugees are unable to access cash independently to support themselves, and many struggle for the basic necessities not already covered by humanitarian assistance. All current assistance in the form of in-kind distributions and services are free of charge. This includes, for example, food, shelter materials, household items and health services. A number of cash-for-work schemes were designed to support and manage some of the basic services and works in the camps; however, to date, they have not created sufficient income opportunities for refugees or host communities. Likewise, our teams have confirmed that some humanitarian aid items are being sold at local markets. This shows refugees are adopting other, and potentially harmful, coping mechanisms to generate cash for their needs that are not, or not fully, covered by current humanitarian assistance. Negative coping strategies such as food borrowing, reduction in the number of meals and reduced consumption of preferred foods are witnessed across the entire Rohingya refugee population. Between April and May 2018, UNHCR piloted the delivery of unconditional and unrestricted Multipurpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to cover unmet basic needs. This extended to all residents of Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement and was equivalent to approximately half of the monthly Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for a family of five.
After completing the delivery of the grants, UNHCR conducted a detailed Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey (320 households were interviewed). A Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey is a mechanism to collect and understand refugees’ feedback on the assistance provided by humanitarian agencies like UNHCR. PDMs are widely used by UNHCR and help to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance provided directly by UNHCR or through its partners. A PDM is conducted independently from the distribution exercise itself, but closely following it in time. This PDM was intended to evaluate the adequacy of the cash grant provided as well as patterns in its use. It also sought to identify challenges and constraints experienced, and seek refugees’ feedback on any improvements required to implement similar assistance again in the future.
The PDM supports a hypothesis that the current basic in-kind assistance packages provided to refugees are not sufficient to meet all demonstrated needs, with the result that potentially harmful coping mechanisms like selling assistance are employed. The adoption of this cash programme by UNHCR, therefore, seeks to ensure that refugees can address their multiple needs in accordance with their household and personal priorities, including benefits such as greater access to a more diversified diet, better hygiene or shelter improvements.",Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement.,Household.,,,"The scope includes:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last. If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. 2019 SENS HH1). The numbering and labelling was done two days prior to commencement of the survey.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals. Data were collected in November 2018 to January 2019, covering about 6004 households.","Kalobeyei Settlement, Kenya",Household and individual,All refugees living in Kalobeyei Settlement,Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and forthcoming Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS). 

Two socio-economic questionnaires were administered - the Basic and the Extended Questionnaires. While all households received the Basic questionnaire, 18.5 percent among them were randomly sampled for the extended questionnaire.

Data collection occurred concurrently with a UNHCR registration verification exercise. Registration records were updated for all households in the settlement. A systematic random sample was then selected for an extended SEP interview. Those who were not selected for the extended interview were administered a shorter, basic version of the questionnaire. For this survey, a stratified single-stage sample design was applied. The sample was implicitly stratified for the three villages in the settlement. For the Basic SEP, all households in the settlement are selected and the selection probability is 1. For the Extended SEP, a targeted sample size of 1500 households was required to obtain a 15 percent difference in the poverty rates of 2 groups in the sample at a confidence level of 95 percent and a power of 80 percent. To randomly select these households, a straight forward approach was used to select these households from registered proGres families before the exercise. Thus, households that received the extended SEP were randomly determined before the start of the survey using the tablet. The sample of the extended survey alone is representative and therefore sufficient for generating poverty estimates headline indicators for the population as a whole.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted between 20 August and 8 September 2018 in the 3 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera) to assess the magnitude and severity of malnutrition, assess trends by comparison with previous years and support programmatic decisions.

The weighted prevalence of global acutemalnutrition, the most important indicator, was 8.0% overall, falling within the POOR category (5-9%). However, there was a marked improvement from 9.7% in 2017. Only Ifo camp was within the SERIOUS category (10-14%). The high prevalence of anaemia remains a major concern, as shown by the anaemia prevalence among children which remained above the 40% critical threshold, despite having decreased. Anaemia prevalence among non-pregnant women jumped to 48.9% overall, from 43.6% in 2017 and was above the 40% threshold for all camps. Some improvement was recorded in terms of infant and young chid feeding indicators, although there is still room for improvement. The access to safe drinking water also continued to be satisfactory, while gaps were still observed in terms of sanitation. The duration of the food ration and dietary diversity basically reflect what has been observed in recent surveys.","Dadaab Refugee Camps (Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera), in Northern Kenya","Children 0-23 months

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years. Abandoned households were not included in the sampling frame. Absent households or households where children were absent were re-visited before the end of the day.

Now in its sixth year, the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) assesses a representative sample of Syrian refugee families to identify changes and trends in their situation. The Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees who have fled their country’s conflict since 2011 (including nearly one million registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2018).  The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains the largest concentration of refugees per capita and the fourth largest refugee population in the world.

The sampling strategy accounted for the need to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level. As such, districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure representativeness of these two districts as governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each.

The first day of training covered findings from the previous year's VASyR, importance and usage of VASyR, ethical considerations, informed consent, defining a household and collecting demographic data. The following four days were dedicated to specific modules of the questionnaire for which sector experts provided trainings. During the last two days, each team completed at least two field tests per day. During these field tests, teams conducted the interviews with selected households. After each day's field tests were completed, the teams gathered and provided feedback to the agency focal points.

These newly displaced populations have been added to the previously affected groups. The situation for the period of November 2016 shows that approximately 302,407 displaced persons live in the Diffa region including refugees (88,688), returnees (29,315) and internally displaced persons (184404). This situation prompted authorities to allow the opening of the Sayam Forage refugee camp, with 12,000 refugees and returnees from Nigeria. 
To prevent the spread of hygiene and sanitation-related diseases in these camps, Action Pour le Bien-Etre (APBE), financially supported by UNHCR, conducted WASH activities on this camp.

ii)	The addresses of 10,076 people were available registered in the registry of Venezuelans who applied for the Temporary Permit of Permanence from the National Superintendency of Migration of the Ministry of the Interior. 
iii)	The blocks containing the addresses of the aforementioned information sources were identified using the Geographic Information System. A global framework of 19,074 blocks was built. 

The concept of block used in the survey is a physical area delimited by streets, avenues, roads, canals, etc. easily identifiable and can contain one or more homes, parks, vacant lots, sports fields, etc. 

The original design of the sample included the construction of three strata based on the number of dwellings with a Venezuelan population found in each block of the sampling frame: 1 to 5, 6 to 10, greater than 10. On the other hand, the population of the city of Lima was divided into 4 zones with the following districts:

North Lima: Los Olivos, San Martn De Porres, Comas, Carabayllo, Independencia, Puente Piedra
East Lima: San Juan De Lurigancho, Ate, Santa Anita, El Agustino, San Luis, La Molina, Lurigancho
Downtown Lima: La Victoria, Lima, Santiago De Surco, Surquillo, San Miguel, Brea, Barranco, Rmac, Lince
Jesus Maria, Magdalena Del Mar, San Borja
South Lima: Chorrillos, San Juan De Miraflores, Villa El Salvador, Villa Mara Del Triunfo, Lurn, Pachacamac

The housing framework was built by means of an exhaustive registry of buildings and dwellings in each of the selected blocks, identifying those places, be they dwellings or establishments, that had a population from Venezuela. The concept of housing for the purposes of the survey included private and collective dwellings (hotels, hostels, lodgings, churches and shelters), where the Venezuelan population is found. This concept is different from the one used in the regular INEI household surveys, which only considers private households with a maximum of 5 households. The concept of the household used was: People, whether or not they are related, who share the main meals and attend to their vital needs in common. This concept is different from that used in the INEI household surveys, where the budget is considered.",Face-to-face [f2f],,,,"[{'name': 'Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática', 'abbreviation': 'INEI', 'affiliation': ''}]","Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica, Peru: Survey Directed to the Venezuelan Population Residing in the Country - 2018.",,,,,"[{'name': 'World Bank Group', 'affiliation': '', 'role': ''}, {'name': 'UNHCR', 'affiliation': '', 'role': ''}, {'name': 'IOM', 'affiliation': '', 'role': ''}, {'name': 'UNFPA', 'affiliation': '', 'role': ''}, {'name': 'UNICEF', 'affiliation': '', 'role': ''}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Despite facing its own economic challenges, for decades Tanzania has welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries of Great Lakes Region. The counties geographic proximity to the strife-torn Congo Basin is responsible in part for the ease access of displaced populations. As well Tanzania was an early signatory in the region to international agreements on the rights and welfare of refugee and asylum seekers.
 
As of December, 2018, Tanzania host some 284,300 camp-based refugees, 77% of who are children and woman, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli Refugee Camps in Kigoma region in Northwest Tanzania. About 74% are from Burundi, and the remaining 26% are primarily from Democratic republic of Congo. 

Following a Tripartite Commission meeting in August 2017, the governments of Tanzania, Burundi, and UNHCR agreed to assist refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate from Tanzania to Burundi. A subsequent meeting in March 2018 reaffirmed the commitment of both governments and UNHCR to uphold the principle of voluntariness, and noted that while some refugees may opt to return, others will continue to be in need of international protection. The March 2018 Tripartite meeting also produced a work plan entailing the repatriation of approximately 2,000 refugees per week from 5 April to 31 December 2018. As from January to 30th September 2018, a total of 52,260 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi from Tanzania in 88 Convoys; bringing the total repatriated from September 2017 to 57,865 of which 57.2% are children.

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The recent arrivals have put additional pressure on the public services delivery system, and to some central elements of the response approach, such as land availability for refugee use. The influx is also aggravated by the fact that refugee hosting areas were already vulnerable due to underlying poverty, limited resilience to shocks, limited capacity of local institutions, and low levels of human capital.

Moreover, it is representative of the refugee and host population in the regions of West Nile and South West, and the city of Kampala. The host population is defined as the native population in districts where refugee settlements are situated. The survey used two different sampling frames. The first one, based on the list of Enumeration Areas (EAs) and the information of the 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, was used to determine the samples for the host and refugee populations of Kampala, and the host populations in West Nile and Southwest. The second one is a newly developed sampling frame for the refugee population in the West Nile and Southwest regions.

Given the nature of the survey, the sample is stratified by three separate domains. The first domain is the host population in the regions of West Nile and South West. The second is the refugee population in the regions of West Nile and Southwest, and the third, the refugee and host population in Kampala. A total of 221 primary sample units were allocated to the three different domains. For each domain, the sample was obtained based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, PSUs were selected using a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method. For the host communities and Kampala, before the selection of the PSUs, district EAs were sorted by residence type (urban/rural), district sub-county, parish, village and EAs. For Kampala, only EAs that contained more than ten refugee households according to the 2014 Census were considered. With this sorting and PPS for the selection of PSUs, implicit stratification by residence type was achieved. For the refugee settlements, EAs were sorted based on the Settlement, Zone, Block, Cluster, Village, EA and by dominant country of origin. The latter was intended to ensure that PSUs with refugees coming from different countries of origin were selected.

Between the first and second stages, a household listing operation was carried out in all selected PSUs outside Kampala. For the listing operation, all selected PSUs were visited and the residential households were located with their address and the name of the household head was recorded. In the second stage, for each selected PSU, ten households were selected from the newly established list using a systematic sampling approach. Household selection was performed in the field prior to the main survey and interviewers only interviewed selected households. This means that no replacements or changes to selected households was allowed in the implementation stage in order to prevent bias. With this design, the survey selected 2,209 residential households, distributed geographically across 13 districts of Uganda

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The primary objective of the 2018-19 UMIS is to provide up-to-date estimates of basic demographic and health indicators related to malaria. Specifically, the 2018-19 UMIS collected information on vector control interventions such as mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides, on intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women, on care seeking and treatment of fever in children, and malaria knowledge, behaviour, and practices.

▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","Twenty-three teams were organised for field data collection with seven people per team. Each team consisted of one supervisor, two health technicians, one interviewer who was also a nurse, two other interviewers, and one driver. The field staff also included a health technician supervisor and four regional laboratory coordinators who followed up with teams to check on and furnish the supplies needed. They also collected slides from the field teams and delivered them to the laboratory at IDRC.

UBOS arranged for printing of questionnaires, manuals, consent forms, brochures, and other field forms, and organised field supplies, which included backpacks, identification cards, and the health technicians’ supplies. UBOS coordinated the fieldwork logistics.

Field data collection for the 2018-19 UMIS started on 11 December 2018 and finished on 31 January 2019. To ensure maximum supervision, the national monitors, largely members of the technical working group, visited all 23 teams over the entire period of data collection.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively. These weights were further normalised at the national level to produce unweighted cases equal to weighted cases for both households and individuals at the national level. The normalised weights are valid for estimation of proportions and means at any aggregation levels, but not valid for estimation of totals.","[{'name': 'Uganda Bureau of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'UBOS', 'affiliation': 'Government of Uganda'}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The first stage of selection was the household (PA) and the second stage was the selection of persons within households. Principal features of the sample design are highlighted below.

The 2017 ASR design replicated the 2016 ASR design, which used a full cross-sectional national sample of refugees entering within the past five years. This section documents the research design, data collection and data processing protocols. It also presents outcomes (e.g., sample sizes) and paradata results such as response rates.

The population of interest - the study population - for the 2017 ASR is defined as refugees entering the U.S. between FY 2013 and FY 2017, inclusive, who are at ages 16 and over at the time of the 2018 ASR interview. Because the interviews were conducted in early 2018, the population includes a small number of refugee respondents younger than 16 at the time of arrival to the U.S.

The 2017 ASR targeted 1,500 completed interviews from refugee households entering the U.S. between FY 2012-2016. The sample was designed to allow for separate estimates and analyses from each of the three designated cohorts. Moreover, the design needed to accommodate both household- and person-level analyses.

The sample was drawn as fresh cross sections by cohort; there was no longitudinal component. The survey objectives required that – in addition to primary stratification by cohort – the sample of households (i.e., PAs) be stratified at least by year of entry and geographic region of origin.

The 2017 ASR sampling frame was ORR’s Refugee Arrivals Data System (RADS) dataset.

The ASR design targeted equal numbers of household interviews by cohort. This means that there was an oversample of households for FY 2016, the most recent year of entry. This allocation prioritizes the statistical precision to cohorts. 

Within each of the three cohort strata, the following factors were used for stratification: year of arrival (for cohorts 1 and 2 only), geographic region, native language, age group, gender, and family size at arrival (1, 2, 3+ persons). Missing contact information status was also used as a stratification variable for cohort 3 due to an unusual degree of missing contact information among FY 2017 arrivals. Proportionate stratified samples were drawn independently within cohort.",Telephone interview,,"For the 2018 ASR, revisions to the 2017 survey instruments and materials were translated into 16 different languages, including English. The survey retained an interpreter to conduct interviews in a 17th language, Chaldean. As in the 2017 ASR, the 2018 questionnaire’s household roster was structured around the respondent. Subsequent demographic questions were asked of respondents first, and repeated for other household members only if their responses were reported to be different (qn1gaa, qn1haa, qn1iaa).","Household- and person-level analytic weights were developed for the 2017 ASR to allow for valid statistical estimates of the target refugee population. Both sets of weights are comprised of two components – a base weight reflecting the selection probability and an adjustment that corrects for differential nonresponse and aligns the population to known totals from the sampling frame (RADS universe file).

Specifically, analytic weights incorporate:

• A base (sampling) weight which reflects the refugee household selection probability. The weight itself is simply the reciprocal of the probability of selection; because the sample allocations of each cohort were managed separately, the selection probabilities varied by the size of the population and the amount of sample released into the field;

• A post-stratification adjustment which corrects the sample for differential nonresponse across cohort and demographic subgroups as well as aligning the sample to known population distributions taken from the RADS.","[{'name': 'Urban Institute (contracted by ORR)', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","Urban Institute. 2018 Annual Survey of Refugees.

This survey was conducted in the population of Mai-Ayni refugee camp which is one of the four Eritrean refugee camps located at a distance of 80 km from zonal town of Shire, at 1170 km from Addis Ababa.  
The population was 2,563 households within the sample frame of the camp, and a systematic random sampling technique was applied.
The survey was conducted in all zones of the camp. To get realistic information we primarily targeted household mothers, since they are more responsible for water, sanitation and hygiene activities in the household; if not present, household head was interviewed; if not present, girls or boys greater than 14 years were interviewed. In case of failure to get either of the above interviewees, the interviewer proceeded to the next house which had occupants available for the interview.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The survey questionnaire used to collect the data consists of the following sections: General Information and Demographics, Water Collection and Storage, Drinking Water Hygiene, Hygiene, Sanitation, Messaging, Distribution, Diarrhoea Prevalence and Health Seeking Behaviour.","There were three group personnel in the survey: interviewers who had direct contact with interviewee, supervisors who supported and monitored interviewers, and a sanitation officer for over all follow up. A total of 9 persons took part in the survey: 7 interviewers, 1 supervisor and 1 IRC national staff (sanitation officer). Participants of the survey were selected from local community components with knowledge of the local language in order to minimize respondent and interviewer bias and avoid inaccurate posing of questions and recording of responses. One supervisor was assigned to check proper data collection and no household was jumped without reason.
To collect the data correctly it was important to give training for interviewers and supervisor to make them familiar with the aims of the survey and how to conduct the interview. A two day training  was  given  on  December 23-24/2017 and the training was given by a sanitation office. The theoretical part was covered on the first day and the field practice and pilot testing were conducted on the second of the training.","Sample weights for the household data were computed dividing, for each zone, the population by the sample size.","[{'name': 'International Rescue Committee', 'abbreviation': 'IRC', 'affiliation': ''}]","Cite this data as follows:

The existing water system consists of three 50m3 capacity concrete reservoirs and 14 water points with six faucets each and seven hand dug wells, meeting UNHCR standards, with the capacity to supply refugees members with more than 20 liters per person per day.

IRC hired 45 EH incentive staffs working on sanitation and HP activities and water system, one water technician officer and one sanitation and hygiene promotion officer for the intervention of environmental health program. 
The objective of the survey was to assess the current change in knowledge, practice and coverage of Shimelba refugee community in relation to water, sanitation and hygiene. 196 households were interviewed. The study revealed that the majority has good knowledge of at least three critical moments of hand washing, but only few respondents have a permanent functional hand washing facility in their household.

The surveys allowed an analysis of a range of socio-economic indicators and the estimation of poverty trends. To provide more frequent poverty estimates, Continuous Household Survey (CHS) was implemented in 2014 on a sub-sample of IHSES clusters. However, the fieldwork was disrupted in the summer of 2014 in some parts of the country due to the deterioration in the security situation. The third round of IHSES, planned for 2017, could not take place on time as well. At the same time, the ongoing security and budget crises made it more important than ever to monitor key socio-economic indicators. The objective of the 2017 rapid welfare monitoring survey (SWIFT) was to provide interim estimates of welfare and well-being until another survey comparable in scope and coverage to IHSES could be fielded.","Although the security situation had improved since 2014, many parts of the country were still insecure 2017. Thus, nine out of ten districts in Nineveh governorate, the seat of Daesh-occupied Iraq, were intentionally excluded from the sampling frame.  As the data collection proceeded, five additional districts – 3 in Anbar, 1 in Baghdad, and 1 in Salah al-din – were judged to be too insecure for fieldwork so the selected enumeration areas from these areas were replaced with other clusters from the same governorate. Thus, the final sample covers only 106 of 120 districts in the country.",Individual and Household,,Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey covered the following topics:

Given the large number of people displaced within the country since 2014, the survey was designed to capture a representative sample of internally displaced persons. Furthermore, given the prevalence of Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan region, the survey also sampled refugee households in Kurdistan. A socioeconomic survey of camp residents was conducted by CSO and KRSO in 2017 so to avoid duplication of effort, the camp residents were excluded from the SWIFT survey. Informal ad-hoc settlements that have been constructed since the last update of sampling frame were included in the survey through household listing operation in the sampled enumeration areas. The survey was designed to cover all governorates, including areas in Nineveh deemed safe for field visits.

The sampling design followed a nested logic. All households in the sample responded to a short questionnaire. The short form collected information on the following core non-monetary indicators of well-being: household roster, education attainment, labor market variables, dwelling characteristics, access to basic services, asset ownership, transfers and assistance (public and private), incidence of shocks, and subjective well-being. A random subset of the sampled households also responded to the complete list of questions on household expenditure. The full sample was designed to be representative for each governorate. The expenditure sub-sample was representation at the regional level, where each region comprises three to five governorates.

Within each governorate, the out-of-camp sample was selected in two stages as following.  First, using the exhaustive list of Census Enumeration Areas as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), between 60 to 150 EAs in each governorate was selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) criteria, with the number of households in each area as the measure of size.  Listing exercise was conducted in the selected areas to update the list of households. In the second stage, using households as secondary sampling units (SSUs), six households were selected in each cluster with equal probability from the post-listing sampling frame. The sample of households in the second stage was stratified by residence status. In selecting six households from a cluster, three each of IDP and non-IDP households were selected in the non-Kurdistan region. In the Kurdistan region, two each of IDP, non-IDP, and refugee households were selected. If an enumeration area in Kurdistan had fewer than two refugee or IDP households, the gap was filled by randomly selecting resident households from the same enumeration area. Likewise, if a PSU in the rest of Iraq had fewer than three IDP households, the shortfall was met by resident households to reach a total of 6 households per PSU.

Expenditure information was collected from a subsample of households from a subsample of enumeration areas. In Kurdistan, one household each of residents, IDPs, and refugees in a subset of clusters responded to the expenditure questions and in Rest of Iraq, one household each of residents and IDPs answered the expenditure questions.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],,The short form questionnaire was implemented by CAPI.

UNHCR conducted an annual SENS nutrition surveys in Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement. 

The 2017 annual Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) at the Kakuma Refugee Camps was conducted from 22nd November to 3rd December 2017. It was coordinated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) with support from World Food Programme (WFP), International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Kenya Red Cross (KRC). The survey used SMART methodology and UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2 (2013) for implementation. While previous surveys indicated a steady decline in GAM prevalence between April 2010 and November 2014. 

There was a considerable increase in GAM prevalence in Kakuma from November 2015 and 2016. Though the difference was not statistically significant. However, in 2017 there has been a significant reduction in GAM prevalence in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei. There has also been a significant change in stunting for Kalobeyei, the same reduction was observed for Kakuma where stunting prevalence has reduced to below the 40% threshold of public health significance. Anaemia in children 6-59 months remains above the 40% threshold of public health significance for both survey areas but anaemia in women, 15-59 years was below 40%. A slight increase was observed in Kakuma while a reduction was observed in Kalobeyei. The November 2017 survey also shows an improvement in Vitamin A supplementation coverage, and water availability. Mosquito net ownership reduced for Kakuma and increased slightly in Kalobeyei.

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last. If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. 2019 SENS HH1). The numbering and labelling was done two days prior to commencement of the survey.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted in the 4 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo, Ifo 2 and Hagadera) between 28 August and 23 September 2017 by nutrition partners (MSF-Switzerland, Islamic Relief Kenya, International Rescue Committee and Kenya Red Cross) with overall coordination by UNHCR supported by WFP.
 
After the increase in the prevalence of GAM observed in 2016 (10.2% weighted prevalence of GAM in all camps from 8.1% in 2015), the 2017 SENS indicated weigthed prevalence of GAM 9.7% which is close to what it was in 2016. The difference between the weighted prevalence of GAM in all the camps in 2016 and 2017 is not statistically significant. However, its to be mentioned that the prevalence of GAM in Dagahaley, Hagdera, and Ifo 2 camp is 8.3%, 8.6%, and 9.4% which is classified as POOR nutrition sitation, while in Ifo camp its 12.7% classified as SERIOUS nutrition sitaition as per the WHO classiciation of the public health significance. Overall, weighted anaemia prevalence showed a sharp increase among children aged 6-59 months to 60.7%, up from 49.7% in 2016. This is well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold) and requires attention. In all camps, anaemia was well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold). The children 6-23 age group had the highest prevalence of anaemia; however, the prevalence in the children 24-35 age group was also very concerning as it was above the critical threshold in all camps.","Dadaab Refugee Camps (Ifo,Ifo2,  Dagahaley and Hagadera), in Northern Kenya","Children 0-23 months

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years. Abandoned households were not included in the sampling frame. Absent households or households where children were absent were re-visited before the end of the day.

In the HFS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum estimated using the 2008 census. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA over the number of listed households in the EA. Sampling weights were then scaled to equal the number of households per strata using the Census 2008 data. 

In the CRS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of structures in the EA divided by the number of structures in the stratum multiplied by the number of EAs selected in the stratum. The number of structures was estimated using satellite imagery of the strata (camps). The selection probability of a household within the EA is decomposed into the selection probability of a block within the EA, the selection probability of a structure within a block, and the selection probability of a household within a structure. The sampling weights are then scaled to equal the number of structures per stratum as per the satellite imagery. In the Bor camp, the total number of households was similar to the target sample size, thus a census was conducted -- therefore, each household had a probability of selection of 1 and thus a sampling weight equal to 1.",,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Currently there are three refugee camps namely Nyarugusu (comprising of Old and New Camps) located in Kasulu, Nduta in Kibondo district and Mtendeli in Kakonko district. 
The oldest refugee camp is Nyarugusu which has been hosting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi since 1996. Refugees from Burundi were repatriated voluntarily in 2012 leading to closure of some of the existing camps. The remainder population in need of protection were relocated to Nyarugusu camp where the total population then was about 65,000 as of early April 2015 majority being Congolese refugees and other minority nationalities such as Rwandese, Sudanese, Ugandans, and Kenyans. 

The refugee situation changed in 2015 following the political instability after the general elections in Burundi leading exodus of some Burundians to Tanzania and other neighbouring countries. As from late April 2015 higher numbers of refugees from Burundi started arriving in Tanzania mainly through a tiny border village along Lake Tanganyika and other entry points in Kigoma region. After the influx, the total population increased causing congestion in Nyarugusu camp calling for the re-opening two camps; Nduta camp on the 7th October 2015 and Mtendeli camp on 14th January 2016. 
Nyarugusu currently hosts Congolese refugees (Old Camp) and 39.4% of the Burundi refugees (New Camp) who arrived at the onset of the emergency.

No longer focusing exclusively on short-term, life-saving interventions, the response should act as a vector for refugees’ integration in the economy; improving management of land, water and natural resources; exploiting the socio-economic opportunities associated with the refugees’ presence, skills and development; and strengthening the hosting districts’ capacity to absorb and manage these resources.  The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. 

In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance.

The sample was drawn as fresh cross sections by cohort; there was no longitudinal component. The survey objectives required that – in addition to primary stratification by cohort – the sample of households (i.e., PAs) be stratified at least by year of entry and geographic region of origin.
A total of 1,500 completed household interviews would require a sample of roughly 4,800 refugees, of which 1,585 would be successfully traced. Thus, the net yield is estimated to be 4,768/1500 = 3.2 sampled Principal Applicants to yield one completed household interview.

The study is based on the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (IASC-2010) Framework on Durable Solutions, which lays the cornerstone for specifying how governments, humanitarian practitioners and academics alike attempt to measure IDPs’ advancement toward durable solutions. The framework defines three 'durable solutions' — sustainable return, sustainable reintegration or sustainable resettlement — each of which depends on the fulfillment of eight criteria: long-term safety and security; adequate standard of living; access to livelihood and employment; access to effective and accessible mechanisms to restore housing, land and property; access to personal and other documentation; family reunification; participation in public affairs and access to effective remedies and justice. IDPs are said to have reached a durable solution when they 'no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on account of their displacement.

The mapping was done from 4 to 12 August 2016 by a team from UNHCR Kenya office and KNBS. 
The mapping in each village commenced with a visit to the chief's office, who put the team in touch with the village chair. The team explained the purpose of its visit to the village chair and began the mapping exercise. The importance of involving the chiefs and village chairpersons is that they are well connected, recognised and trusted by residents in their communities. The same procedure is followed by KNBS when they are mapping for sample surveys and censuses.
The team established physical boundaries of the area to be mapped, located the boundaries on the map and then identified and listed the Pemba households within the enumeration boundary.  A Pemba household, in this context, is one identified by the informants as having at least one person with origins or links to Pemba. The links may include a person's spouse, parents or grandparents, who migrated to Kenya from Pemba or where a person has migrated from Pemba to Kenya. 
The mapping team was followed by the village chair to the Pemba households, where the UNHCR and Haki Centre staff listed number of persons in each, while the KNBS staff marked the location of the household on the map. The entrances of identified Pemba households were marked in chalk with the letters HCR and a number starting at 001 to make it easier to find the houses during the enumeration. Since it seems to be generally well known where the Pemba live it was not considered stigmatising to mark their doors. During the feedback forums with the Pemba after the survey, there was no mention of stigmatization due to marking the door with chalk. 
The maps were from the 2009 national housing and population census, purchased from KNBS. The team made lists with information about the location, number and size of each household. The mapping team visited 17 villages in Kilifi and Kwale (see Table 1 in Section 2.7). All villages visited were identified before the mapping exercise by key informants as locations being home to the Pemba of Kenya. The key informants were Pemba elders in different sub-counties previously identified for providing background information on the Pemba arrival and history in Kenya. In each sub-country, the chief, the assistant chief or the village chair also accompanied the team. In Kwale, 358 households were identified with 2,220 persons, and in Kilifi, 86 households with 558 persons.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaire was developed before the pilot survey and revised during and after the pilot survey, based on the experience gained. The pilot survey was used to test the questions and to check for inconsistences and misinterpretations due to unclear concepts and definitions. The testing process also revealed some important themes that had been left out.
The structure of the questionnaire was altered, including the order of the questions and the introductory pages, to facilitate administration of the questionnaire.
Finally, the questionnaire was translated into Swahili. Both the English and Swahili versions were used in the survey, even though the English version was preferred by almost all interviewers. The two versions of the questionnaire are attached in Annex 4 and 5. Enumerators used the English questionnaire to frame the questions in the local and less academic version of Swahili.","Most of the enumerators had been recruited during the pilot study and the majority were retained. A few new enumerators were recruited for the main survey. Haki Centre, a non-governmental human rights organization based in Mombasa, played an important role in the recruitment. Some of the requirements were that the enumerators should be fluent in English and Swahili, that they had completed secondary school education, and that they had an interest in the overall objectives of the survey. Preference was given to interviewers living in Pemba villages. The recruitment also considered gender and diversity.
Before the pilot study, the enumerators were given a basic training on statelessness and why it occurs in Kenya, including the background of the Pemba of Kenya.  A two-day training session for enumerators was held in Mombasa before the main survey (see the program in Annex 9). The session began with an introduction of the instructors and the participants and a discussion of administrative and practical arrangements with respect to the interviewers and supervisors, such as working time, allowances and transport arrangements. During the training, a presentation of the scope and purpose of the survey was given. The roles of the interviewers and supervisors were discussed and a list of tasks for interviewers and supervisors were distributed.",,"[{'name': 'UNHCR', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]",UNHCR (2016).

Pre-Fieldwork Quality control starts at the pre-fieldwork stage, where certain checks are built into the survey programming that help to prevent human data entry error. Interviewers are briefed on the instrument as specified above and receive special skills-based training on how to communicate with lower-income segments. Strategies such as practice interviewing are typically used. However, this was not possible because of the condensed timeline of the study.  
 
During Fieldwork Ipsos reviews data on a daily basis to monitor incoming data for broad trends that would indicate the questionnaire is being interpreted or administered wrong. In the case of this study, no issues were flagged. If any issue had been identified, call-backs would be conducted to re-administer the relevant sections of the survey and confirm responses for missing answers or those that seemed inaccurate. If responses are unable to be confirmed, or still have outstanding logic issues or missing answers, they are dropped from the study and replaced. There were no cases of this for this study.  
To ensure the quality of information collected in field, several quality assurance procedures were put in place. As noted above, 43% of the sample was randomly selected for a callback to verify responses given in specific sections, and 29% of interviews were accompanied by a supervisor. Supervisors applied routing checks to 5% of all interviews to ensure that interviewers were beginning at the specific starting points and applying all random walk procedures.

Post-Fieldwork After fieldwork was complete, the data file was checked for overall logic and completeness – these checks were focused on demographic data and called back for validation or dropped from the sample.",,,,,,,Refer to “Digittances Quantitative Data User Guide”,,,,,,,,,

Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level.

What was particularly attractive about the latest census from the perspective of sampling was that it explicitly asked about the nationality of all residents. This would have allowed stratification of areas by density of Syrians. However, the original design could not be implemented because we could not access the new sample frame based on the 2015 Jordanian census. The design was then amended to include a representative sample of the Azraq and Za'atari camps (which account for the vast majority of Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan). This sample was complemented by purposive samples of the surrounding governorates, Mafraq and Zarqa, where the sample included areas physically proximate to the camp and other areas with a high number of Syrian refugees. In Amman Governorate, a purposive sample was drawn, combining a geographically distributed sample with a sample of areas with a high prevalence of Syrian refugees per the 2015 census, as indicated by the Jordanian Department of Statistics. Analytically, this implies the insights from Jordan will be limited to camp residents, neighboring areas of the camps, and Amman governorate. For this reason, Amman is left out of the rest of the discussion, where our focus is on relating the innovative approaches that we followed to obtain near-representative sample in absence of recent sampling frame.

A probabilistic sampling approach was used for IDPs from Somaliland, refugee returnees, economic migrants and host community living in settlements. The sample in the settlements was stratified by population group and was representative at the total population level. The distribution of each population group was proportionate to their size in each settlement and was considered when distributing the sample across the settlements. For the IDPs from South Central Somalia and refugees/asylum seekers, a non- probabilistic sampling approach was adopted due to the relatively small size of these population groups and scattered distribution in the urban area of Hargeisa. For the IDPs originating from south- central Somalia and residing in the urban areas of Hargeisa outside of the known settlements, the profiling deployed respondent- driven sampling, whereby the individuals being surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know. In turn, the next individuals surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know, and so forth (snowball sampling). Therefore, results cannot be generalised to the total population, but can give a good indication of the situation of the SC IDPs living outside of settlements.

In countries as diverse as Costa Rica, Mali and Qatar, trained fieldwork teams conduct face-to-face interviews with household members on a variety of topics - focusing mainly on those issues that directly affect the lives of children and women. MICS has been a major source of data on the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators and will be a major data source in the post-2015 era.

The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Round 5 (MICS5) is the fifth round of MICS surveys, previously conducted around 1995 (MICS1), 2000 (MICS2), 2005-2007 (MICS3) and 2009-2011 (MICS4). MICS was originally developed to support countries measure progress towards an internationally agreed set of goals that emerged from the 1990 World Summit for Children.

The fifth round of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS5) is scheduled for 2013-2016 and survey results are expected to be available from 2015 onwards. Data collected in MICS5 will play a critical role in the final assessment of the MDGs in September 2015 and subsequent surveys in MICS6 will provide the baselines for the Sustainable Development Goals that will follow.

Information on more than 130 internationally agreed-upon indicators is being collected through MICS5. In addition to collecting information on intervention coverage, MICS also explores knowledge of and attitudes to certain topics, and specific behaviors of women, men and children, enabling analysts to gain insights into behaviours that may affect women's and children's lives. MICS routinely disaggregates data so that disparities associated with age, gender, education, wealth, location of residence, ethnicity and other characteristics are revealed.","- v01:  Edited, anonymous datasets for public distribution.",,"The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (PMICS) was carried out in 2014 by Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with Ministry of Health, as part of the global MICS programme. Technical and financial support was provided by the Palestinian Government, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

The global MICS programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s as an international household survey programme to support countries in the collection of internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women. MICS surveys measure key indicators that allow countries to generate data for use in policies and programmes, and to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed upon commitments.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives:
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action.
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Palestine and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2014 was conducted for a representative sample of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster sample covering the entire country including two geographic regions; The West Bank which includes 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Salfit, Nablus, Ramallah and Al Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho and Al Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and Gaza Strip which includes 5 governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza) and was stratified according to urban, rural and camp areas.

Of the 11,125 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 10,568 of which 10,182 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 96 percent. There were 13,964 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 13,367 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 96 percent. In addition, the number of children was 7,919 child in the Household Questionnaire of which a total of 7,816 child were interviewed giving a response rate of 99 percent. The total households interviewed included 56,367 individual members who were listed. Of these, 28,542 were males and 27,825 were females with a sex ratio of 103 males per hundred females.

It is noted that the Palestinian population is a young one. The percentage of individuals in the age group 0-17 years was 46 percent, whereas the percentage of individuals in the age group 18 and above was 54 percent. According to economic and social dependency categories, 39 percent individuals were in the age group 0-14 years, 58 percent in the age group 15-64 years which is the age category of economically active individuals; and 3 percent in the age group 65 years and over. The average household size in Palestine in 2014 was about 5.5 persons. About 91 percent of households are headed by men and about 9 percent of households are headed by women. The findings pertain to March-April 2014, when the fieldwork was conducted.","West Bank: Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Salfit, Nablus, Ramallah and Al Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho and Al Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron

Urban, rural and camps areas in each of the governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sample size for the Palestinian MICS was calculated as 11,125 households. For the calculation of the sample size, the key indicator used was stunting prevalence among children age 0-4 years.

The number of households selected per cluster for the Palestinian MICS was determined as 25 households, based on a number of considerations, including the design effect, the budget available, and the time that would be needed per team to complete one cluster. Dividing the total number of households by the number of sample households per cluster, we obtain a sample of 445 clusters.

The 2007 census frame was used for the selection of clusters. Census enumeration areas were defined as primary sampling units (PSUs), and were selected from each of the sampling strata by using systematic pps (probability proportional to size) sampling procedures, based on the number of households in each enumeration area from the 2007 Population and Housing Census frame. The first stage of sampling was thus completed by selecting the required number of enumeration areas from each of the sixteen governorates, separately for the urban, rural and camps strata.

Since the sampling frame (the 2007 census) was not up-to-date, a listing of households was conducted in all the sample enumeration areas (EAs) prior to the selection of households. For this purpose, listing teams were formed who visited all of the selected enumeration areas and listed all households in these enumeration areas. The listing was conducted in 416 enumeration areas; this excludes 29 sample EAs in Jerusalem within the barriers J1. A total of 266 EAs were updated in the West Bank area and 150 EAs in the Gaza Strip. A 5-day training took place during the first week of September in order to provide the fieldworkers with the skills needed for conducting the listing in the sample EAs for the Palestinian Multiple Indicator Survey 2014. The main listing field work was conducted during the period September - October, 2014.

Lists of households were prepared by the listing teams in the field for each enumeration area. The households were then sequentially numbered from 1 to n (the total number of households in each enumeration area) at the Central Statistical Office, where the selection of 25 households in each enumeration area was carried out using random systematic selection procedures.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014 - Final Report"" pp.203-207.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS5 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes List of Household Members, Education, Child Discipline, Household Characteristics, Water and Sanitation and Salt Iodization.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. The questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child.

The women's questionnaire includes Woman's Background, Fertility/Birth History, Desire for Last Birth, Maternal and Newborn Health, Post-natal Health Checks, Contraception, Unmet Need, Marriage and HIV/AIDS.

The children's questionnaire includes Child's Age, Birth Registration, Early Childhood Development, Breastfeeding and Dietary Intake, Immunization, Care of Illness and Anthropometry.

The questionnaires are based on the MICS5 model questionnaire. From the MICS5 model English version, the questionnaires were customised and translated into Arabic and were pre-tested in December, 2013 in 4 clusters, out of each cluster 25 households were selected for interview, 25 households in Al-Bireh city and 25 households in Ramallah city (Urban), 25 households in Abu-Qash village (rural) and 25 in Al-Jalazoun refugee camp (refugee camps). The clusters were covered Ramallah governorate in the central of the West Bank. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. In addition to the administration of questionnaires, fieldwork teams tested the salt used for cooking in the households for iodine content, observed the place for handwashing, and measured the weights and heights of children age under 5 years.","Training for the fieldwork was conducted for 16 days in February /2014. Training included lectures on interviewing techniques and the contents of the questionnaires, and mock interviews between trainees to gain practice in asking questions. Towards the end of the training period, trainees spent 2 days in practice interviewing in Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron governorates in the West Bank, and Gaza, Deir El-Balah, Khan Yunis governorates in Gaza Strip.

The data were collected by 28 teams; each was comprised of 4-5 interviewers, one editor, one measurer and a supervisor. Fieldwork began in March/2014 and concluded in April/2014.","The Palestinian MICS sample is not self-weighting. Essentially, by allocating equal numbers of households to each of the regions, different sampling fractions were used in each region since the sizes of the regions varied. For this reason sample weights were calculated and these were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data.

The major component of the weight is the reciprocal of the sampling fraction employed in selecting the number of sample households in the particular sampling stratum and PSU.

A final component in the calculation of sample weights takes into account the level of nonresponse for the household and individual interviews. The adjustment for household nonresponse in each stratum is equal to: 1/RRh
where RRh is the response rate for the sample households in stratum h, defined as the proportion of the number of interviewed households in stratum h out of the number of selected households found to be occupied during the fieldwork in stratum h.

The non-response adjustment factors for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires were applied to the adjusted household weights. Numbers of eligible women and under-5 children were obtained from the roster of household members in the Household Questionnaire for households where interviews were completed.

The design weights for the households were calculated by multiplying the inverse of the probabilities of selection by the non-response adjustment factor for each enumeration area. These weights were then standardized (or normalized), one purpose of which is to make the weighted sum of the interviewed sample units equal to the total sample size at the national level. Normalization is achieved by dividing the full sample weights (adjusted for nonresponse) by the average of these weights across all households at the national level. This is performed by multiplying the sample weights by a constant factor equal to the unweighted number of households at the national level divided by the weighted total number of households (using the full sample weights adjusted for nonresponse). A similar standardization procedure was followed in obtaining normalized weights for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires. Adjusted (normalized) household weights varied between 0.226 and 2.316 in the 445 sample enumeration areas (clusters).

Sample weights were appended to all data sets and analyses were performed by weighting households, women, or under-5s with these sample weights.","[{'name': 'Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'PCBS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Cost: None","Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between the estimates from all possible samples. The extent of variability is not known exactly, but can be estimated statistically from the survey data.

The following sampling error measures are presented in this appendix for each of the selected indicators:
- Standard error (se): Standard error is the square root of the variance of the estimate. For survey indicators that are means, proportions or ratios, the Taylor series linearization method is used for the estimation of standard errors. For more complex statistics, such as fertility and mortality rates, the Jackknife repeated replications method is used for standard error estimation.
- Coefficient of variation (se/r) is the ratio of the standard error to the value (r) of the indicator, and is a measure of the relative sampling error.
- Design effect (deff) is the ratio of the actual variance of an indicator, under the sampling method used in the survey, to the variance calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling based on the same sample size. The square root of the design effect (deft) is used to show the efficiency of the sample design in relation to the precision. A deft value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design of the survey is as efficient as a simple random sample for a particular indicator, while a deft value above 1.0 indicates an increase in the standard error due to the use of a more complex sample design.
- Confidence limits are calculated to show the interval within which the true value for the population can be reasonably assumed to fall, with a specified level of confidence. For any given statistic calculated from the survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error (r + 2.se or r – 2.se) of the statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

For the calculation of sampling errors from MICS data, programs developed in CSPro Version 5.0, SPSS Version 21 Complex Samples module and CMRJack1 have been used.

Sampling errors are calculated for indicators of primary interest, for the national level, for urban, rural and camps areas and for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Three of the selected indicators are based on households members, 10 are based on women, and 2 are based on children under 5.","A series of data quality tables are available to review the quality of the data and include the following:

The 2012 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS) is the sixth Demographic and Health Survey conducted in Jordan. Like the first five JPFHS, conducted respectively in 1990, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2009, the 2012 JPFHS was carried out by the Department of Statistics (DoS).

The content of the 2012 JPFHS was significantly expanded from the 2007 and 2009 surveys to include additional questions on women’s status, reproductive health, domestic violence, early childhood development, and child discipline.

The 2012 JPFHS was designed to collect data on ever-married women of reproductive age (age 15-49). The areas covered include demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, reproduction, family planning, maternal health care, breastfeeding and child health care, marriage and employment, fertility preferences, nutritional status of children under age 5, knowledge of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), domestic violence, early childhood development, and child discipline.

The survey was executed in three stages; the first was the preparatory stage, which involved sample design, mapping, listing of households, and implementation of sampling procedures. At the same time, the survey questionnaires and instruction manuals were developed, pretested, and finalized. All of these activities were completed by August 2012. The second stage encompassed interviewing and the collection of data, while the third stage involved office editing of questionnaires, coding of open-ended questions, ensuring data completion and data consistency, data processing operations, final editing, and verification of data accuracy and consistency.",,,"The Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS) is part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Surveys Program, which is designed to collect data on fertility, family planning, and maternal and child health.

The primary objective of the 2012 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS) is to provide reliable estimates of demographic parameters, such as fertility, mortality, family planning, and fertility preferences, as well as maternal and child health and nutrition, that can be used by program managers and policymakers to evaluate and improve existing programs.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was designed to produce reliable estimates of major survey variables for the country as a whole, urban and rural areas, each of the 12 governorates, and for the two special domains: the Badia areas and people living in refugee camps. To facilitate comparisons with previous surveys, the sample was also designed to produce estimates for the three regions (North, Central, and South). The grouping of the governorates into regions is as follows: the North consists of Irbid, Jarash, Ajloun, and Mafraq governorates; the Central region consists of Amman, Madaba, Balqa, and Zarqa governorates; and the South region consists of Karak, Tafiela, Ma'an, and Aqaba governorates.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was selected from the 2004 Jordan Population and Housing Census sampling frame. The frame excludes the population living in remote areas (most of whom are nomads), as well as those living in collective housing units such as hotels, hospitals, work camps, prisons, and the like. For the 2004 census, the country was subdivided into convenient area units called census blocks. For the purposes of the household surveys, the census blocks were regrouped to form a general statistical unit of moderate size (30 households or more), called a ""cluster"", which is widely used in surveys as a primary sampling unit (PSU).

Stratification was achieved by first separating each governorate into urban and rural areas and then, within each urban and rural area, by Badia areas, refugee camps, and other. A two-stage sampling procedure was employed. In the first stage, 806 clusters were selected with probability proportional to the cluster size, that is, the number of residential households counted in the 2004 census. A household listing operation was then carried out in all of the selected clusters, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 20 households was selected in each cluster with an equal probability systematic selection. A subsample of two-thirds of the selected households was identified for anthropometry measurements.

Refer to Appendix A in the final report (Jordan Population and Family Health Survey 2012) for details of sampling weights calculation.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The 2012 JPFHS used two questionnaires, namely the Household Questionnaire and the Woman’s Questionnaire (see Appendix D). The Household Questionnaire was used to list all usual members of the sampled households, and visitors who slept in the household the night before the interview, and to obtain information on each household member’s age, sex, educational attainment, relationship to the head of the household, and marital status. In addition, questions were included on the socioeconomic characteristics of the household, such as source of water, sanitation facilities, and the availability of durable goods. Moreover, the questionnaire included questions about child discipline. The Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women who were eligible for the individual interview (ever-married women age 15-49 years). In addition, all women age 15-49 and children under age 5 living in the subsample of households were eligible for height and weight measurement and anemia testing.

The Woman’s Questionnaire was administered to ever-married women age 15-49 and collected information on the following topics:
• Respondent’s background characteristics
• Birth history
• Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of family planning and exposure to family planning messages
• Maternal health (antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care)
• Immunization and health of children under age 5
• Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices
• Marriage and husband’s background characteristics
• Fertility preferences
• Respondent’s employment
• Knowledge of AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Other health issues specific to women
• Early childhood development
• Domestic violence

In addition, information on births, pregnancies, and contraceptive use and discontinuation during the five years prior to the survey was collected using a monthly calendar.

The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS program. Additions and modifications to the model questionnaires were made in order to provide detailed information specific to Jordan. The questionnaires were then translated into Arabic.

Anthropometric data were collected during the 2012 JPFHS in a subsample of two-thirds of the selected households in each cluster. All women age 15-49 and children age 0-4 in these households were measured for height using Shorr height boards and for weight using electronic Seca scales. In addition, a drop of capillary blood was taken from these women and children in the field to measure their hemoglobin level using the HemoCue system. Hemoglobin testing was used to estimate the prevalence of anemia.","The fieldwork was organized to ensure control over field logistics by DoS field offices all over the country. The workload, the dispersion of sample units, and transportation facilities served as criteria for identifying the number of field staff in each area. The field staff consisted of 26 field teams, each made up of one supervisor, one field editor, one biomarker technician, and three to four interviewers; two field coordinators supervised the 26 teams. During field work, these teams were combined or reformulated as necessary. Fieldwork was carried out between 9 September and 20 December, 2012.

To facilitate data collection, each interviewing team was assigned a number of clusters in the sample area. Each field supervisor, in collaboration with the field coordinator, divided his team so as to ensure that all adjacent sampled households were completed by one interviewer. To ensure good data quality, interviewers were asked to conduct fewer interviews during the first three days of data collection; the completed questionnaires were then checked by the field editor and the supervisor to ensure completeness and consistency of data. Under the supervision of the survey director and field coordinators, the field editor and the supervisor conducted spot checks by randomly visiting some sampled households and reinterviewing respondents with the household schedule. The original questionnaires were then matched to the reinterview questionnaires, and any differences were discussed with the interviewer and reconciled where necessary.

Interviewers made at least three call backs to attempt to successfully complete the interview of eligible women. Once a cluster was finished, the questionnaires were delivered to the DoS central office in Amman for processing.",,"[{'name': 'Department of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'DoS', 'affiliation': 'Government of Jordan'}]",,,"Fieldwork and data processing activities overlapped. Data processing began two weeks after the start of the fieldwork. After field editing of questionnaires for completeness and consistency, the questionnaires for each cluster were packaged together and sent to the central office in Amman, where they were registered and stored. Special teams were formed to carry out office editing and coding of the openended questions.

Data entry and verification started after two weeks of office data processing. The process of data entry, including 100 percent reentry, editing, and cleaning, was done by using PCs and the CSPro (Census and Survey Processing) computer package, developed specially for such surveys. The CSPro program allows data to be edited while being entered. Data processing operations were completed by early January 2013. A data processing specialist from ICF International made a trip to Jordan in February 2013 to follow up on data editing and cleaning and to work on the tabulation of results for the survey preliminary report, which was published in March 2013.

Nonsampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the 2012 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS) to minimize this type of error, nonsampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically.

Sampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents selected in the 2012 JPFHS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and identical size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling error is a measure of the variability between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results.

A sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2012 JPFHS sample is the result of a multistage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex formulae. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the 2012 JPFHS is an SAS program. This program used the Taylor linearization method for variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for variance estimation of more complex statistics such as fertility and mortality rates.

The Taylor linearization method treats any percentage or average as a ratio estimate, r = y/x, where y represents the total sample value for variable y, and x represents the total number of cases in the group or subgroup under consideration.

Total 646,318

The frame was divided into strata depending on the homogeneity of the divided parts as follows:
A) Governorates: 16 in the West Bank and Gaza.
B) The type of locality: city, village and refugee camp.

Sample Design and Type

Three Stage Stratified Cluster Sample of 2022 persons (2022 households). The sample design was as follows:
1. Stage one: selection a sample of 60 representative localities covering all strata.
2. Stage two: selection a random sample of Palestinian households from each location selected in the first stage.
3. Stage three: random selection of one person from each household using Kish table within the age group of 18 years old and above. Half of the sample will be male and half is female respondents.

Sample Size
The sample size was 2022 persons from all Palestinian territories aged 18 years and above. Main regions covered by the sample are: the West Bank (excluding Ramallah), Ramallah and Gaza Strip. The sample was distributed as follows:

Region  / # of Households 

Ramallah and Al Bireh 350 
West Bank 1000 
Gaza Strip 672 
Total 2022 

The margin of error in the main key variables is approximately 2.5% on the entire sample size and it should be bigger in the detailed domains.

Sample Representation:

The researchers ensured that the sample is representative of the following during the field work:

1) Geographical representation: the sample distribution covers all governorates of the West Bank (including Jerusalem) and Gaza strip, thus provides a comprehensive geographical representation.
2) Economic Activity: in general, Ramallah and Al Bireh governorate is considered the economic and commercial center and thus was given a higher weight in the sample compared to the rest of the localities.
3) Economic Sectors: the sample covered different economical sectors such as employees of industrial, services and commercial sectors (usually in the main cities), workers in the agricultural sector (rural areas) and workers in the informal sector (mostly in Gaza).
4) Poverty levels: the sample covers poor localities as provided by statistics. In general, Gaza is considered poorer than the West Bank. Also, refugee camps and some localities particularly in North West Bank are considered poorer than the rest of localities and the above sample distribution provides coverage of such localities.
5) Age Groups: the sample covered all age groups above the age of 18. The reason behind selecting the starting age to be 18 is the fact that it is within this age that an individual is expected to become involved with financial transactions and thus will be dealing with financial services.
6) Gender: the sample was gender balanced; half of the respondents were males and half were females. This corresponds with the gender distribution of the Palestinian Territories.
7) Infrastructure: the sample covered central and remote localities to guarantee representation of poor versus good infrastructure and availability of services including financial services.",Face-to-face [f2f],"A standard questionnaire was previously developed by the World Bank and was adapted to the Palestinian context by Riyada Consulting.

The far-reaching goal of this research was to assess prospects for peace and reintegration among both civilian and former-combatant populations in Aceh. The immediate goals of the ARLS were twofold. One was to collect individual-level data for an impact evaluation of the World Bank’s BRA-KDP project, a post-conflict community-drive development program. The second was to collect livelihood and reintegration data on a representative sample of ex-combatants, and a control group of civilian males.

Male respondents were sampled from two randomly sampled households in selected rural villages and eight randomly sampled households in urban villages. A representative sample of male respondents can be achieved by combining the SHS and the  male  sub-population  of  the  LHS.

- Dwellings: No
- Vacant units: No
- Households: Yes
- Individuals: Yes
- Group quarters: Yes

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: Structurally separate units with their own entrance from the street, or a stairwell in permanent buildings, that are suitable for residential purposes. Dwellings consist of one room or multiple rooms with ancillary rooms. It makes no difference whether a kitchen or kitchenette is present.
- Households: All persons living in a dwelling or similar accommodation as their main residence form a private household. The size of the household therefore corresponds to the number of people with their main residence in the dwelling. Up to the 1991 Population Census, the housekeeping-unit concept was used, according to which all persons living together and jointly managing a household formed a private household.
- Group quarters: An institutional household is an establishment that is used for the accommodation and care of a group of persons ? normally over the longer term. The term covers boarding schools, student residences, senior citizen and nursing homes, monasteries, military barracks, penal institutions, refugee centres, facilities for disabled, socially deprived or homeless persons, homes for young people or trainees and similar institutions. In contrast to the 2001 Population Census, the 2011 register-based census also considers non-institutional forms of living together in collective living quarters (e.g. company accommodation, hotels, etc.) as institutional households.Solely main residence registrations are recorded. Because of secondary residence registrations, the actual occupancy of individual facilities may be higher.","[{'name': 'Austria', 'abbreviation': 'AUT'}]",,"[{'topic': 'Technical Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: A-L Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Group Quarters Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Dwelling Characteristics Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Household Economic Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Technical Person Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Demographic Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Nativity and Birthplace Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Migration Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Education Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Work Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Work: Industry Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Family Interrelationship Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: Global Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}]","[{'start': '2011-05-15', 'end': '2011-05-15', 'cycle': ''}]","MICRODATA SOURCE: Statistics Austria

A one-stage stratified sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The target sample size for the Roma communities MICS was calculated as 1,800 households in 62 municipalities. Data from MICS3 on Roma in Serbia in 2005 was used to calculate specific indicators. At the time of the sample design the Serbian MICS3 was the only unique source of data on the Roma population in the sub-region (BiH, Montenegro, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia). The key indicator used for the calculation of the sample size was the immunisation coverage rate for the tuberculosis vaccine amongst children aged 18-29 months. Out of the 30 indicators 17 required a smaller sample size than 1,800 households and the remaining 13 required a larger sample size of households. Of the 13 indicators that required a larger sample size than that of 1,800 households the average size of the confidence interval for a sample of 1,800 households was calculated at 7.4 percent.

Sampling frames for the Roma population were non-existent in BiH until 2009 when MHRR BiH conducted an enumeration of Roma in BiH as part of activities within the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015.

The master sample frame was prepared using information from the 2009 enumeration. During the 2009 enumeration procedure data was collected on 4,307 Roma households living in Roma communities in 67 municipalities. The total number of municipalities in BiH is 142. Data from the remaining 75 municipalities was not collected due to a lack of information on the presence of Roma in these municipalities. Five municipalities with 1 Roma household were excluded from the master sample frame.

Municipalities in the FBiH, RS and BD were identified as the sample strata and a one-stage stratified sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample, with households defined as the primary sampling units (PSUs).

Households were selected from each of the sampling strata (municipalities) by using systematic pps sampling procedures, based on the estimated sizes of the strata from the 2009 enumeration of Roma in BiH.

All households where the head of household declared himself or herself to be of Roma ethnicity were considered as Roma households.

Households were selected within each stratum based on the date of birth of the household head. If the date of birth of the household head was not available then the date of birth of the next oldest person in the household with an available date of birth was used. If none of the household members had an available date of birth then the date of birth of the interviewer was used as the reference.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Bosnia and Herzegovina Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2011 - Roma Settlements - Final Report"" pp.144-147.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS4 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes household listing form, education, water and sanitation, household characteristics, child discipline and hand washing.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49, children under age five and men age 15-49. For children, the questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child. 

The women's questionnaire includes woman's background, access to mass media and ICT, child mortality, desire for last birth, maternal and newborn health, illness symptoms, contraception, unmet need,  attitudes toward domestic violence, marriage/union, sexual behavior, HIV/AIDS, tobacco and alcohol use, life satisfaction and health care.

The children's questionnaire includes child's age, birth registration, early childhood development, breastfeeding, care of illness, immunisation and anthropometry.

The men's questionnaire includes man's background, access to mass media and ICT, child mortality, attitudes toward domestic violence, marriage/union, sexual behavior, HIV/AIDS, tobacco and alcohol use, life satisfaction and health care.

The questionnaires were based on the MICS4 model questionnaire. From the MICS4 model English version the questionnaires were translated into the local languages used in BiH. The questionnaires were pre-tested in the FBiH in three municipalities in Sarajevo Canton (Centar, Ilijas and Novo Sarajevo) during September 2011. The plan provided for 18 households to be interviewed (9 each in urban and rural areas). These households were selected using a random selection method based on the date of birth of the household head. On the basis of the pre-test results, modifications were then made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires for the survey.","Training for the fieldwork was conducted over 12 days13 during October 2011. Training included lectures on interviewing techniques and the content of the questionnaires as well as practical work that offered practice in asking the questions. Towards the end of the training period the trainees spent two days conducting practice interviews in urban and rural areas in the municipalities of Novi Grad (Sarajevo) and Visoko.

Fieldwork was conducted by three teams. Each team was comprised of 4 interviewers (2 female and 2 male interviewers), one editor, one measurer and a supervisor. Fieldwork began on 9 November 2011 and was concluded on 30 March 2012.","The Roma Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in BiH sample was not self-weighting. In order to obtain representative results for the Roma settlements, sample weights were calculated. These sample weights were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data. In the calculation of the weights the initial number of households by municipality (from the 2009 enumeration of Roma) was replaced by updated data collected during the fieldwork listing.

Since the original sample allocation was based on the 2009 sampling frame, there were cases where the number of households selected in the municipality was greater than N’h, in which case a value of 1 was used for the first stage probability of selection instead of the formula.

A second component in the calculation of sample weights accounted for the level of non-response for the households and individuals interviews. The adjustment for household non-response is equal to the inverse value of: 
RRh = Number of interviewed households in stratum h/ Number of occupied households listed in stratum h

After completion of the fieldwork the response rates were calculated for each sampling stratum. These were used to adjust the sample weights calculated for each cluster.

The non-response adjustment factors for women’s, men’s and under-5’s questionnaires were applied to the adjusted household weights. Numbers of eligible women and children under-5 were obtained from the roster of household members in the Household Questionnaire for households where interviews were completed.

The design weights for the households were calculated by multiplying the above factors for each enumeration area. These weights were then standardised (or normalised), one purpose of which was to make the weighted sum of the interviewed sample units equal to the total sample size at the national level.

Normalisation was achieved by dividing the full sample weights (adjusted for non-response) by the average of these weights across all households at the BiH level. This was performed by multiplying the sample weights by a constant factor equal to the unweighted number of households at the national level and divided by the weighted total number of households (using the full sample weights adjusted for non-response). A similar standardisation procedure was followed for obtaining standardised weights for the women’s, men’s and children under-5 questionnaires. Adjusted (normalised) weights varied between 0.483875 and 2.859160 in the 62 sample municipalities.

Sample weights were appended to all data sets and analyses were performed by weighting each household, woman, men or child under-5 with these sample weights.","[{'name': 'Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees', 'abbreviation': 'MHRR BiH', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'abbreviation': 'BHAS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Each of these samples would have yielded results that differed somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between the estimates from all possible samples. The extent of variability is not known exactly but can be estimated statistically from the survey data.

The simple one-stage stratified sample design for the MICS survey on Roma in BiH is reflected in the calculations of the sampling errors, whereby the strata are municipalities and the primary sampling units (PSUs) are households (clusters of persons).

Given the overall high sampling rate (1,800/3,784), sampling without replacement was used in order to apply a finite population correction factor. As part of the estimation procedure, the first stage sampling rate for each stratum (municipality) was specified. For strata with a sampling rate of 1, the finite population correction factor was zero (resulting in a zero variance component for the corresponding stratum).

The sampling error measures below are presented in this appendix for each of the selected indicators.

- Standard error (se): Sampling errors are usually measured in terms of standard errors for particular indicators (means, proportions etc). Standard error is the square root of the variance of the estimate. The Taylor Linearization method was used for the estimation of standard errors.
- Coefficient of variation (se/r): is the ratio of the standard error to the value of the indicator and is a measure of the relative sampling error.
- Design effect (deff): is the ratio of the actual variance of an indicator, under the sampling method used in the survey, to the variance calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling. The square root of the design effect (deft) is used to show the efficiency of the sample design in relation to the precision. A deft value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a deft value above 1.0 indicates an increase in the standard error due to the use of a more complex sample design.
- Confidence limits: are calculated to show the interval within which the true value for the population can be reasonably assumed to fall with a specified level of confidence. For any given statistic calculated from the survey the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error (r + 2.se or r – 2.se) of the statistic in 95 per cent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

The SPSS Version 18 Complex Samples Module was used for the calculation of sampling errors within the MICS data. Sampling errors were calculated for indicators of primary interest for the BiH, FBiH, RS and BD levels. Five of the selected indicators were based on household members, 19 were based on women, 10 were based on men and 17 were based on children under 5. All indicators presented here are in the form of proportions.","A series of data quality tables are available to review the quality of the data and include the following:

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as is well known, there is no completely reliable sample frame or information about universe. The main reasons for such a situation are migrations caused by war and lack of recent census data. The last census dates back to 1991, but since then the size and distribution of population has significantly changed. In such a situation, researchers have to combine all available sources of population data to estimate the present size and structure of the population: estimates by official statistical offices and international organizations, voters? lists, list of polling stations, registries of passport and ID holders, data from large random surveys etc. 

The sample was three-stage stratified: in the first stage by entity, in the second by county/region and in the third by type of settlement (urban/rural). This means that, in the first stage, the total sample size was divided in two parts proportionally to number of inhabitants by entity, while in the second stage the subsample size for each entity was further divided by regions/counties. In the third stage, the subsample for each region/county was divided in two categories according to settlement type (rural/urban). 

Taking into the account the lack of a reliable and complete list of citizens to be used as a sample frame, a multistage sampling method was applied. The list of polling stations was used as a frame for the selection of primary sampling units (PSU). Polling station territories are a good choice for such a procedure since they have been recently updated, for the general elections held in October 2010. The list of polling station territories contains a list of addresses of housing units that are certainly occupied. 

In the second stage, households were used as a secondary sampling unit. Households were selected randomly by a random route technique. In total, 104 PSU were selected with an average of 10 respondents per PSU. The respondent from the selected household was selected randomly using the Trohdal-Bryant scheme. 

In total, 1036 citizens were interviewed with a satisfactory response rate of around 60% (table 1). A higher refusal rate is recorded among middle-age groups (table 2). The theoretical margin of error for a random sample of this size is +/-3.0%. 

Due to refusals, the sample structure deviated from the estimated population structure by gender, age and education level. Deviations were corrected by RIM weighting procedure. 


MORE DETAILED INFORMATION

IPSOS designed a representative sample of approximately 1.000 residents age 18 and over, proportional to the adult populations of each region, based on age, sex, region and town (settlement) type. 

For this research we designed three-stage stratified representative sample. First we stratify sample at entity level, regional level and then at settlement type level for each region. 

Sample universe:

Population of B&H -18+; 1991 Census figures and estimated population dynamics, census figures of refugees and IDPs, 1996. Central Election Commision - 2008; CIPS - 2008; 	

Sampling frame:

Polling stations territory (approximate size of census units) within strata defined by regions and type of settlements (urban and rural)  Polling stations territories are chosen to be used as primary units because it enables the most reliable sample selection, due to the fact that for these units the most complete data are available (dwelling register - addresses) 	

Type of sample:

Three stage random representative stratified sample 	

Definition and number of PSU, SSU, TSU, and sampling points 	

- PSU - Polling station territory  Definition: Polling stations territories are defined by street(s) name(s) and dwelling numbers; each polling station territory comprises approximately 300 households, with exception of the settlements with less than 300 HH which are defined as one unite.

The questionnaire used in the Financial Literacy Survey in Romania was localized for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including adaptations to match the Bosnian context and methodological improvements in wording of questions.","Data for this survey were collected by means of in-home face-to-face interviews, using a highly structured questionnaire. Data collection was conducted by the Ipsos agency. All interviewers participating in data collection were specifically trained for this project, including detailed rules for the selection of respondents, rules for asking respondents questions and rules for data collection itself. Seven local coordinators (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Bihac, Banja Luka, and Bijeljina) conducted verbal instructions in their respective areas, based on written instructions prepared by Ipsos researchers with the help of consultants working on this project. Interviewers engaged in particular regions were selected depending on their ethnic and local language background in order to decrease refusal rates and to avoid negative ""halo effect"". Data collection was performed from 4th May to 15th May 2011. 

IPSOS filed work is organized in following way: 

We have 7 local coordinators in B&H, in 7 centers of major regions: Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Bihac, Banja Luka, Bijeljina. Each of them controls a number of trained interviewers, on a daily basis. In our Sarajevo office we have central fieldwork manger that is responsible for central coordination of project in B&H. 

Each local coordinator organizes trainings for their interviewers. 
Interviewers are obligated to send completed interviews to their local coordinator every day. 
Interviewers engaged in particular regions were selected depending on their ethnic and local language background in order to decrease response rates and to avoid ""halo effect"". 

Both coordinators and interviewers received training in details on project subject, target group(s), techniques in selecting households and respondents, rules for back-checks, recording response rates 

Scheduling and assignment of interviews 

* Interviewer had to find the starting point according the instructions (street and number of the dwelling/ building). From the starting point, interviewer went into the instructed direction in order to identify the first dwelling (e.g. goes in direction of increasing numbers of dwellings and on the right side of the street, and enters into the third dwelling from the starting point ). When enters in the dwelling, he/she follows the procedure of choosing the apartment (only one apartment in the building can be visited in a family house, but several in high-rise buildings); the interviewer is instructed in which floor to go, and how to choose the apartment, etc.) 

* After choosing the apartment, interviewer use TCB tables for the choice of the respondent 

* Non response situations 
a) No one at home: interviewer comes back at least 1 time in another time of day, if without success. 
b) Refused by the person who open the door: interviewer is not coming back, and notes it with all details (sex, age of the assumed respondent, reasons for the interview not being realized) in the interviewer's diary (contact form) 
c) The respondent not available: same as under (a) 
d) Selected respondent refuses the interview: respondent is not replaced by another person from the same HH, interviewer notes it with all details (sex, age of the assumed respondent, reasons for the interview not being realized) in the interviewer's diary (contact form) 
Interviewers are taking notes in Interviewers diary (contact form). 

Interviewers are instructed to schedule the interviews in the afternoon-after working hour, except on weekends.

Quality control in the field 

Interviewers were monitored in several ways. First, regional coordinators checked 5% of each interviewers work in the field. Second, 20-25% of interviewers' work was checked by phone from our central office. Fieldwork control verifies the following aspects of interviewers' work: 
- Fact that the interview has actually taken place; 
- Proper application of the sampling plan in selecting the respondents; 
- Approximate duration of the interview; 
- Proper administration of the various sections of the questionnaire, and 
- Interviewers' general adherence to professional standards. 

Following data collection, 100% logic and consistency controls are performed, both by local supervisors and staff in local office.

The survey is based on a representative sample of 6,838 households in BiH (4,107 in FBiH, 2,408 in RS and 323 in Brcko District (BD) of BiH) with an overall response rate of 91 per cent (in total, 5,778 households were interviewed). The results reflect data collected during the period November 2011 and March 2012.

The survey was undertaken as part of the fourth global round of the MICS programme and implemented by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMH) and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of the Republic of Srpska (MHSW RS) in cooperation with the Institute for Public Health of the FBiH (IPH FBiH) and the Agency for Statistics of BiH (BHAS). Financial and technical support was provided by UNICEF with additional financial support provided by UN Women for preparing the master sample frame, as well as by UNFPA and UNHCR.

The primary aim of MICS is to provide indicators for monitoring the level of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, the Plan of Action for A World Fit for Children as well as other international and national commitments undertaken by BiH.

A two stage stratified sampling approach was used for the selection of the cluster sample.

The official population estimate for BiH is 3.8 million inhabitants living in about one million households. However, some sampling frame exercises conducted due to the lack of an official Census since 1991 estimate this number at approximately 3.3 million.

As stated previously, BiH is composed of three administrative units: two entities, the FBiH and RS and a third administrative unit, BD. The FBiH covers approximately 51 per cent of the territory of BiH and 62 per cent of the population. RS covers approximately 49 per cent of the territory and about 36 per cent of the population and BD covers less than 1 per cent of the territory and approximately 2 per cent of the population.

The target sample size was 6,800 households, which was determined based on lessons learned through the previous round of MICS as well as by budgetary limitations. The standard sample design used in most of the countries participating in the MICS programme needed to be adapted for BiH due to the low birth rate; therefore, it was necessary to target (oversample) households with children under 5 and members aged 5-24.

Accordingly, the sample was stratified by households with children under 5 (type 1), households with children aged 5-24 (type 2) and all other households (type 3). In addition, the size of the three strata could not jeopardise the indicator estimates for the other target populations, such as the indicators that referred to fertile women.

As the sample size was defined as 6,800 households it was necessary to calculate the size of stratum 1 and stratum 2. The size of stratum 3 was obtained as the difference between the total sample size and the sum of the size of strata 1 and 2.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Bosnia and Herzegovina Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2011 - Final Report"" pp.150-153.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS4 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes household listing form, education, water and sanitation, household characteristics, child discipline and hand washing.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49, children under age five and men age 15-49. For children, the questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child. 

The women's questionnaire includes woman's background, access to mass media and ICT,  child mortality, desire for last birth, maternal and newborn health, illness symptoms, contraception, unmet need,  attitudes toward domestic violence, marriage/union, sexual behavior, HIV/AIDS, tobacco and alcohol use, life satisfaction and health care.

The children's questionnaire includes child's age, early childhood development, breastfeeding, care of illness, immunisation and anthropometry.

The men's questionnaire includes man's background, access to mass media and ICT, attitudes toward domestic violence, marriage/union, sexual behavior, HIV/AIDS, tobacco and alcohol use, life satisfaction and health care.

The questionnaires were based on the MICS4 model questionnaire.19 From the MICS4 model English version, the questionnaires were translated into local languages used in BiH. The questionnaires were pre-tested in the FBiH and RS in the City of Banja Luka and in Sarajevo Canton during September 2011. The pre-test plan provided for interviews to be conducted in 48 households in the FBiH and 24 households in RS. The households, of which 50 per cent were urban and rural households respectively, were randomly selected from the Master Sample template. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.","Training for the fieldwork was conducted over 12 days during October 2011 for the survey teams in the FBiH and in November 2011 for the survey teams working in RS and BD. Training included lectures on interviewing techniques and the content of the questionnaires as well as practical work on presenting the questions. Towards the end of the training period the trainees spent two days conducting practice interviews in urban and rural areas in the City of Banja Luka and Sarajevo Canton.

The fieldwork was conducted by eight teams in the FBiH and 4 teams in RS. These teams were generally comprised of 3 interviewers (two female and one male), one editor, one measurer and a supervisor. In some cantons in the FBiH the size of the team was determined by the number of households to be interviewed during the fieldwork. Fieldwork in the FBiH began in November 2011 and was concluded in February 2012, while fieldwork in RS began in November 2011 and was concluded in March 2012.","The BiH Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey sample is not self-weighting. Essentially, by allocating households in all three strata different sampling fractions were obtained by strata due to the variability in size of strata. The weights calculated were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data.

Since the PSUs were selected with equal probability in each stratum during the first stage and that all listed households in each second stage stratum were combined across sampled clusters the weights were calculated using a combination of the first and second stage strata (for a total of 9 groups).

In order to calculate first stage selection probabilities the number of sampled EAs (PSUs) in each stratum was divided by the total number of EAs from the 2009 Master Sample.57 The second stage selection probability was obtained by dividing the number of valid households (secondary sampling units (SSUs)) selected in each second stage stratum by the total number of households listed in the stratum. Table SD.5 shows the first stage selection probabilities of PSUs by stratum and the second stage probability of SSUs in each stratum.

A second component in the calculation of sample weights took into account the level of non-response for the household and individual interviews.","[{'name': 'Federal Office of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'FOS', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Republic of Srpska Institute of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'RSIS', 'affiliation': ''}, {'name': 'Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'abbreviation': 'BHAS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Each of these samples would have yielded results that differed somewhat from the results of the actual selected sample. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between the estimates from all possible samples. The extent of variability is not known exactly but can be estimated statistically from the survey data.

The sampling error measures below are presented in this appendix for each of the selected indicators.
- Standard error (se): Sampling errors are usually measured in terms of standard errors for particular indicators (means, proportions etc). Standard error is the square root of the variance of the estimate. The Taylor Linearization method was used for the estimation of standard errors.
- Coefficient of variation (se/r): is the ratio of the standard error to the value of the indicator and is a measure of the relative sampling error.
- Design effect (deff): is the ratio of the actual variance of an indicator, under the sampling method used in the survey, to the variance calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling. The square root of the design effect (deft) is used to show the efficiency of the sample design in relation to the precision. A deft value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a deft value above 1.0 indicates an increase in the standard error due to the use of a more complex sample design.
- Confidence limits: are calculated to show the interval within which the true value for the population can be reasonably assumed to fall with a specified level of confidence. For any given statistic calculated from the survey the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error (r + 2.se or r – 2.se) of the statistic in 95 per cent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

The SPSS Version 18 Complex Samples Module was used for the calculation of sampling errors within the MICS data. The results are shown in the tables that follow. In addition to the sampling error, the measures described above, the tables also include weighted and unweighted counts of denominators for each indicator.

Sampling errors were calculated for indicators of primary interest, for the BiH, FBiH, RS and BD level and for urban and rural areas. Five of the selected indicators were based on household members, 17 were based on women, 9 were based on men and 16 were based on children under 5. All indicators presented here are in the form of proportions.","A series of data quality tables are available to review the quality of the data and include the following:

The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted as part of the fourth global round of MICS surveys (MICS4).  The survey provides up to date information on the health, economic, and social situation of women and children; in addition to providing information on characteristics of the family in which each woman and child live as well as the main indicators about the categories of youth and elderly. This offers a study, analysis, and understanding of the actual indicators and their relationship with demographic, social, economic, and environmental variables. The survey also measures the major indicators which allows countries to monitor their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) besides measuring the level of fulfilling other internationally agreed upon commitments; in addition to enabling policy and decision makers, and intervention programs to evaluate the plans and programs, amend them, and locate the areas of intervention based on the results. The carry out of the survey also aims at updating the databases on women and children as well as building and enhancing the technical staff capabilities of carrying out surveys and analyzing data out of them. The Palestinian Family survey conducted in 2010 was led by a technical team from the Palestinians Central Bureau of Statistics, UNICEF, and UNFPA, and Ministry of Health.

Urban and rural areas and the refugee camps in each of the sixteen governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sampling frames used has been established in PCBS,and basically comprises the list of enumeration areas. (The enumeration area is a geographical area containing a number of buildings and housing units of about 120 housing units on average.)

The total frame consists of the following two parts:
1- West Bank and Gaza Sampling Frame: containing enumeration areas drawn up in 2007. In the West Bank: each enumeration area consists of a list of households with identification data to ascertain the address of individual households. In Gaza: each enumeration area contains a list of housing units with addresses to ascertain the address of individual households, plus identification data of the housing units.
2- Jerusalem Sampling Frame (J1): contains enumeration areas only, geographically divided with information about the total number of households in these areas. However, there is no detailed information about addresses inside enumeration areas and the size of the enumeration area can be ascertained without the ability to identify the addresses.

Both frames were used in the sample design and selection and therefore, the sample will differ from one frame to another. Also, the method of reaching the sample units by interviewers may differ.

In the survey, two variables were chosen to divide the population into strata, depending on the homogeneity of parts of the population.
Previous studies have shown that Palestinian households may be divided as follows:
1- Governorates: there are 16 governorates in the State of Palestine: 11 governorates in the West Bank and 5 in the Gaza Strip.
2- Locality Types: there are three types : urban, rural and refugee Camps.

After determining the sample size, which equals 15,355 households, we selected a probability sample - a multi-stage stratified cluster sample as follows:
1- First stage: selecting a sample of clusters (enumeration areas) using PPS without replacement method to obtain 644 enumeration areas from the total enumeration area frame.
2- Second stage: selecting 24 households from each selected enumeration area of the first stage and using the systematic sample method. When reaching households, all individuals were interviewed from the eligible groups i.e. women 15-54 years, elderly aged 60 years or above and children aged 0-4 years
3- Third stage: selecting one child of age group 2-14 years for part of the questionnaire and one young person from the 15-29 age group to answer the youth attachment in the questionnaireThe Kish table was used to select one child at random.
4- Also in the women's health section, the questionnaire was administered to a maximum of three randomly selected women aged 15-54 years irrespective of their marital status living in the households. In the case where 3 or less women aged 15-54 were listed in the HH all women were interviewed. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non-response cases. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non response cases.
5- The elderly age 60 years and above questionnaire was administered for all elderly persons within the household.
6- The Youth questionnaire was administered by randomly selecting a youth member from households with odd household numbers assigned at the enumeration area level. Within this sample female and male youth were alternatively selected.

The sample was allocated with proportionally using the design strata of the governorates and the locality type according to the proportion of the population in the 2007 Census.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Family Survey 2010 - Final Report"" pp.167-171.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The design of the survey complied with the standard specifications of health surveys previously implemented by PCBS. In addition, the survey included indicators of MICS4 to meet the needs of all partners.

Five sets of questionnaires were used in the survey, three are considered as main questionnaires and are based on MICS4 standard questionnaires,viz.: 1) a household questionnaire which was used to collect information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and the dwelling; and a section on general health and knowledge of HIV and AIDS adminstered to three randomly selected women 15-54 years in each houehold, irrespective of marital status, 2) a women’s questionnaire administered in each household to all ever-married women aged 15-54 years (to allow for comparison with the previous survey, however, all the tables and analysis were undertaken for the women aged 15-49 only; 3) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers or caretakers for all children under-5 years living in the household. The two additional country specific questionnaires were, 4) the youth aged 15-29 years old questionnaire; and 5) the elderly (60+ years old) questionnaire.

• Household Questionnaire: Covers demographic and educational characteristics, chronic disease, smoking, discipline of children (2-14 years), child labor (5-14 years), education of children (5-24 years) and housing characteristics.
• Women’s Health (15-54 years) Questionnaire: regardless of marital status, awareness about AIDS, anemia in women aged 15-49 years.
• Ever married women (15-54 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics of eligible women, reproduction, child mortality, maternal care, reproductive morbidity, family planning, and attitudes towards reproduction.
• Children under age of 5 Questionnaire: Covers children’s health, vaccination against childhood diseases, early childhood development, chronic disease, and anemia.

Supplementary Questionnaires
• Youth (15-29 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, awareness and perception of family planning, health status, awareness about sexually transmitted diseases and reproduction.
• Elderly (60 years and over) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, social relations, activities, time-use, health status, and use of mass media.

The main three questionnaires (household, women and children under-5) are based on the MICS4 model questionnaires. Using the Arabic version of the MICS4 statndard questionnaires, the questionnaires were customized to the local context and were piloted in February 2010. Based on the results of the pilot, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.","Training for the fieldwork was conducted for 13 days in April 2010. Training included lectures on interviewing techniques and the topics covered in the questionnaires. Mock interviews were conducted between trainees to gain practice in asking questions. The data were collected by 22 teams; each having of 4 or 5 interviewers, one editor, one measurer and a supervisor. Fieldwork began in May 2010 and concluded in September 2010.","Sampling weights are necessary to make the results of the sample are representative to the target population, and to adjust the bias resulting from differences between the sample characteristics and the reference population characteristics which mainly coming from the non-response and non-coverage of the frame.

The steps of calculation the design weight:
1- In the first stage: the weight of enumeration areas (PSUs) were calculated depending on the probability of each enumeration area((PPS) sample selection).
2- In the second stage: the weight of households were calculated in each enumeration area.
3- Design households weights resulted from product of weights of first stage and second stage.
4- Merging design households weights to the households file and to the household individuals file, each individual obtained the weight of his/her household weight ,and it is considered initial weight for individuals (all households members)

Adjustment of sample weights for non-response:
The weights of the households and individuals were adjusted to non-response cases, which are explained in the result of the interview, and we got the adjusted weights for non- response of the sample.
The adjustment factor for household non-response is equal to:
Fnr = sample of occupied households in stratum h /sample of interviewed households in stratum h
Similarly, the adjustment factor for non-response at the individual level (women and under-5 children) for each stratum is equal to:
Fnr = Eligible women (or under-5s) in stratum h /Completed women’s (or under-5’s) questionnaires in stratum h These factors were multiplied by the design weights to get the adjusted weights for non-response.

Weights Calibration (post-stratification):
This form of weighting adjustment compensates for differences between the achieved distribution for the sample for some characteristic and known population distribution for that characteristic (hlweight). The source of distributions are population counts from projections. Furthermore, the population in the control totals should match the population surveyed. For example, if a population was excluded from the survey due to age groups, the same population should be excluded from the projections. the post-stratification method of adjustment was used to compensate for non-coverage.

Standardization of weights:
Standardized weights obtained from dividing the weights of the sample unit by the average of the weights, so the weights were standardized in such way that the total weighted sample interviewed is equal to the total unweighted.","[{'name': 'Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'PCBS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Cost: None","Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between the estimates from all possible samples. The extent of variability is not known exactly, but can be estimated statistically from the survey data.

The following sampling error measures are presented in this Annex for each of the selected indicators:
• Standard error (se): Sampling errors are usually measured in terms of standard errors for particular indicators (means, proportions etc). Standard error is the square root of the variance of the estimate. The Taylor linearization method is used for the estimation of standard errors.
• Coefficient of variation (se/r) is the ratio of the standard error to the value of the indicator, and is a measure of the relative sampling error.
• Design effect (deff) is the ratio of the actual variance of an indicator, under the sampling method used in the survey, to the variance calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling. The square root of the design effect (deft) is used to show the efficiency of the sample design in relation to the precision. A deft value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a deft value above 1.0 indicates the increase in the standard error due to the use of a more complex sample design.
• Confidence limits are calculated to show the interval within which the true value for the population can be reasonably assumed to fall, with a specified level of confidence. For any given statistic calculated from the survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error (r + 2.se or r – 2.se) of the statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

For the calculation of sampling errors from MICS data, SPSS Version 19 Complex Samples module has been used. The results are shown in the tables that follow. In addition to the sampling error measures described above, the tables also include weighted and unweighted counts of denominators for each indicator.

Sampling errors are calculated for indicators of primary interest, for the national level, for the regions, and for urban and rural areas. One of the selected indicators is based on households, 8 are based on household members, 16 are based on women, and 18 are based on children under 5. All indicators presented here are in the form of proportions.","A series of data quality tables are available to review the quality of the data and include the following:

- Age distribution of the household population
- Age distribution of eligible and interviewed women
- Age distribution of children under 5 in household and children under 5 questionnaires
- Women’s completion rates by socio-economic characteristics of households
- Completion rates for under-5 questionnaires by socio-economic characteristics of households
- Completeness of reporting
- Completeness of information for anthropometric indicators
- Heaping in anthropometric measurements
- Observation of under-5s birth certificates
- Observation of vaccination cards
- Presence of mother in the household and the person interviewed for the under-5 questionnaire
- School attendance by single age
- Sex ratio at birth among children ever born and living
- Births by calendar years
- Reporting of age at death in days
- Reporting of age at death in months

MEASURE DHS is sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to assist countries worldwide in obtaining information on key population and health indicators. 

The purpose of the SLDHS is to collect national- and regional-level data on fertility and contraceptive use, marriage and sexual activity, fertility preferences, breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women and young children, childhood and adult mortality, maternal and child health, female genital cutting, awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, adult health, and other issues. The survey obtained detailed information on these topics from women of reproductive age and, for certain topics, from men as well. The 2008 SLDHS was carried out from late April 2008 to late June 2008, using a nationally representative sample of 7,758 households. 

The survey results are intended to assist policymakers and planners in assessing the current health and population programmes and in designing new strategies for improving reproductive health and health services in Sierra Leone. 

MAIN RESULTS

FERTILITY 

Survey results indicate that there has been little or no decline in the total fertility rate over the past two decades, from 5.7 children per woman in 1980-85 to 5.1 children per woman for the three years preceding the 2008 SLDHS (approximately 2004-07). Fertility is lower in urban areas than in rural areas (3.8 and 5.8 chil­dren per woman, respectively). Regional varia­tions in fertility are marked, ranging from 3.4 births per woman in the Western Region (where the capital, Freetown, is located) to almost six births per woman in the Northern and Eastern regions. Women with no education give birth to almost twice as many children as women who have been to secondary school (5.8 births, com­pared with 3.1 births). Fertility is also closely associated with household wealth, ranging from 3.2 births among women in the highest wealth quintile to 6.3 births among women in the lowest wealth quintile, a difference of more than three births. Research has demonstrated that children born too close to a previous birth are at increased risk of dying. In Sierra Leone, only 18 percent of births occur within 24 months of a previous birth. The interval between births is relatively long; the median interval is 36 months. 

FAMILY PLANNING 

The vast majority of Sierra Leonean women and men know of at least one method of contra­ception. Contraceptive pills and injectables are known to about 60 percent of currently married women and 49 percent of married men. Male condoms are known to 58 percent of married women and 80 percent of men. A higher propor­tion of respondents reported knowing a modern method of family planning than a traditional method. 

About one in five (21 percent) currently married women has used a contraceptive method at some time-19 percent have used a modern method and 6 percent have used a traditional method. However, only about one in twelve cur­rently married women (8 percent) is currently using a contraceptive method. Modern methods account for almost all contraceptive use, with 7 percent of married women reporting use of a modern method, compared with only 1 percent using a traditional method. Injectables and the pill are the most widely used methods (3 and 2 percent of married women, respectively), fol­lowed by LAM and male condoms (less than 1 percent each). 
 
CHILD HEALTH 

Examination of levels of infant and child mortality is essential for assessing population and health policies and programmes. Infant and child mortality rates are also used as indices re­flecting levels of poverty and deprivation in a population. The 2008 survey data show that over the past 15 years, infant and under-five mortality have decreased by 26 percent. Still, one in seven Sierra Leonean children dies before reaching age five. For the most recent five-year period before the survey (approximately calendar years 2003 to 2008), the infant mortality rate was 89 deaths per 1,000 live births and the under-five mortality rate was 140 deaths per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate was 36 deaths per 1,000 live births and the post-neonatal mortality rate was 53 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate was 56 deaths per 1,000 children surviving to age one year. 
Mortality rates at all ages of childhood show a strong relationship with the length of the pre­ceding birth interval. Under-five mortality is three times higher among children born less than two years after a preceding sibling (252 deaths per 1,000 births) than among children born four or more years after a previous child (deaths 81 per 1,000 births). 

MATERNAL HEALTH 

Almost nine in ten mothers (87 percent) in Sierra Leone receive antenatal care from a health professional (doctor, nurse, midwife, or MCH aid). Only 5 percent of mothers receive antenatal care from a traditional midwife or a community health worker; 7 percent of mothers do not re­ceive any antenatal care. 

In Sierra Leone, over half of mothers have four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits, about 20 percent have one to three ANC visits, and only 7 percent have no antenatal care at all. The survey shows that not all women in Sierra Leone receive antenatal care services early in preg­nancy. Only 30 percent of mothers obtain ante­natal care in the first three months of pregnancy, 41 percent make their first visit in the fourth or fifth month, and 17 percent in have their first visit in the sixth or seventh month. Only 1 per­cent of women have their first ANC visit in their eighth month of pregnancy or later. 

BREASTFEEDING AND NUTRITION 

Poor nutritional status is one of the most im­portant health and welfare problems facing Si­erra Leone today and particularly afflicts women and children. The data show that 36 percent of children under five are stunted (too short for their age) and 10 percent of children under five are wasted (too thin for their height). Overall, 21 percent of children are underweight, which may reflect stunting, wasting, or both. For women, at the national level 11 percent of women are con­sidered to be thin (body mass index <18.5); however, only 4 percent of women are consid­ered severely thin. At the other end of a spec­trum, 20 percent of women age 15-49 are con­sidered to be overweight (body mass index 25.0­25.9) and 9 percent are considered obese (body mass index =30.0). 

HIV/AIDS 

The HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the most serious health concerns in the world today be­cause of its high case-fatality rate and the lack of a cure. Awareness of AIDS is relatively high among Sierra Leonean adults age 15-49, with 69 percent of women and 83 percent of men saying that they have heard about AIDS. Nevertheless, only 14 percent of women and 25 percent of men are classified as having 'comprehensive knowl­edge' about AIDS, i.e., knowing that consistent use of condoms during sexual intercourse and having just one faithful, HIV-negative partner can reduce the chances of getting HIV/AIDS, knowing that a healthy-looking person can have HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and knowing that HIV cannot be transmitted by sharing food/utensils with someone who has HIV/AIDS, or by mosquito bites. 

Such a low level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS implies that a concerted effort is needed to address misconceptions about the transmission of HIV in Sierra Leone. Compre­hensive knowledge is substantially lower among respondents with no education and those who live in the poorest households. Programmes could be targeted to populations in rural areas, and especially women in the Northern and Southern regions and men in the Eastern Region, where comprehensive knowledge is lowest. A composite indicator on stigma towards people who are HIV positive shows that only 5 percent of women and 15 percent of men age 15-49 ex­pressed accepting attitudes towards persons liv­ing with HIV/AIDS. 
 
FEMALE CIRCUMCISION 

The 2008 SLDHS collected data on the prac­tice of female circumcision (or female genital cutting) in Sierra Leone. Awareness of the prac­tice is universally high. Almost all (99 percent) of Sierra Leonean women and 96 percent of men age 15-49 have heard of the practice. The preva­lence of female circumcision is high (91 per­cent). Most women (82 percent) reported that the cutting involves the removal of flesh. The most radical procedure, infibulation-when vagina is sewn closed during the circumcision-is re­ported by only 3 percent of women. The survey results indicate that almost all of the women were circumcised by traditional practitioners (95 percent); only a small proportion of circumci­sions were performed by a trained health profes­sional (0.3 percent). 

Among Sierra Leonean adults age 15-49 who have heard of female circumcision, more men than women oppose the practice (41 and 26 percent, respectively), which is similar to pat­terns in other West African countries.",The survey used a nationally representative sample.,"- Household

The 2008 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS 2008) is the first DHS survey carried out in the country, although it shares many similarities with previous surveys such as MICS-1 (1995), MICS-2 (2000), and MICS-3 (2005). Based on a nationally representative sample of approximately 8,000 households and 10,000 complete women interviews, the main objectives of the SLDHS 2008 were to provide up-to-date information on fertility and childhood mortality levels; fertility preferences; awareness, approval, and use of family planning methods; maternal and child health; knowledge and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STI); prevalence level of HIV/AIDS. All women age 15-49 who slept in the selected households the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed with the Woman's Questionnaire. The survey results are representative for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas, and for each of the four provinces. 

Separate from the main survey of women and children, a survey of men was conducted in one of every two households selected for the main survey. All men age 15-59 who slept in the households selected for the men's survey were interviewed using the Men's Questionnaire. All eligible men age 15-59 and all eligible women age 15-49 in the households selected for male survey were eligible for HIV testing. 

SAMPLING FRAME 

Administratively, Sierra Leone is divided into 4 provinces. Each province is divided into districts, each district is divided into chiefdoms, and each chiefdom is divided into sections. In total, there are 14 districts, 149 chiefdoms, and 1,320 sections. Among the 14 districts, Bo City from Bo district, Bonthe City from Bonthe district, Kenema City from Kenema district, Koidu City from Kono district and Makeni City from Bombali district were separated from the district to form 5 city councils; the rest of the 5 districts form 5 local councils; the other 9 districts each forms a local council. So in total, there are 19 local councils. The five city councils together form a domain of study. For the purpose of the SLDHS, the local councils were adopted as a secondary domain of study. Samples were allocated to each local council and by urban-rural residence within each council. 

In addition to these administrative units, during the 2004 Sierra Leone Population and Housing Census (SSL, 2006b), each section was subdivided into convenient area units called Enumeration Areas (EAs), which were compiled electronically into a complete list of all the EAs. The list contains census information on household, population, urban-rural specifications, and administrative matters, etc. for every EA. The census EAs were used as the primary sampling units (PSUs), also called clusters, for the 2008 SLDHS. The sample was selected from the frame of PSUs provided by Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL). The frame excluded the population living in collective housing units, such as hotels, hospitals, work camps, prisons, and the like.. 

In total, there are 9,671 EAs in Sierra Leone; 2,903 EAs are located in urban areas and 6,768 EAs are located in rural areas. On average, a census EA has 102 households in urban areas and 77 households in rural areas, with an overall average of 85 households per EA. In Sierra Leone, 35.8 percent of the household population lives in urban areas and they occupy 36.3 percent of the households, according to the sampling frame. The statistics from the sampling frame show no differences when compared with the 2004 Population and Housing Census; this indicates that the sampling frame covers the whole country. 

SAMPLE ALLOCATION AND SAMPLE SELECTION 

The 2008 SLDHS sample was a stratified sample selected in two stages from the 2004 census frame. Stratification was achieved by separating each local council into urban and rural areas. The West Urban Area and the 5 city councils have only urban areas; in total, 32 sampling strata were constructed. The samples were selected independently in each stratum, using a two-stage selection procedure. By sorting the sampling frame according to administrative order and by using a probability proportional to size selection in the first stage sampling, an implicit stratification and proportion alallocation was achieved at each administrative level. 

The sample allocation takes into account precision at the domain level. While it would be best to allocate the 10,000 completed women's interviews proportionally to each sampling stratum by stratum size, such a proportional allocation would allocate too small a sample size for the domain Local Councils. DHS surveys in the other countries show that to obtain reasonable precision for most DHS indicators at the domain level, at least 800 completed interviews of women 15-49 are needed for each domain. On the other hand, for survey precision to be comparable across domains, the samples should (as much as possible) be similar in size. This means that the proportional allocation cannot be used. Instead, a power allocation was used-allocation proportional to a power of the stratum size; it is between the proportional allocation and the equal size allocation. 

The sample allocation was done in two steps: first, a power allocation was used to allocate the target number of complete women 15-49 to each domain; then the domain sample size was proportionally allocated to each sampling stratum-that is, the urban and rural areas of each local council-within the domain. The sample allocation was then converted to number of households by applying the average number of women 15-49 per household and response rates at household level and the individual level, respectively. The 2004 Population and Housing Census shows that there are 1.53 women age 15-49 per household. By assuming a response rate of 95 percent forboth households and women, and a sample take of 22 households per EA, the sample allocation of EAs and households by domain and local council, and by urban-rural specification was carried out (Table 4). In total, 353 EAs were selected with 145 EAs in urban areas and 208 EAs in rural areas; 7,766 households were selected with 3,190 households in urban areas and 4,576 households in rural areas. 

The sampling procedure for the men's survey was to interview men age 15-59 in one of every two households selected for the women's survey. The 2004 Population and Housing Census showed an average of 1.5 men age 15-59 per household (SSL, 2006b). By assuming a response rate of 90percent, the expected number of completed interviews for men age 15-59 was 4,976 (2,042 in urban areas and 2,934 in rural areas). Urban areas were slightly over sampled because of the creation of the five city councils as a domain. 

Prior to the main survey, a household listing operation was carried out in all of the selected EAs, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. Some of the selected EAs were large in size; to minimize the task of household listing, selected EAs that had more than 200 households were segmented. Only one segment was selected for the survey with probability proportional to the segment size. The household listing was conducted only in the selected segment; therefore, a SLDHS 2008 cluster is either an EA or a segment of an EA. Household selection in the second stage was an equal probability systematic selection offixed size: 22 households per cluster. The fixed second stage sample size facilitates allocation of workloads to different interviewers and as well as quality control during fieldwork. 

In the central office, a spreadsheet with the selected household numbers for each cluster was prepared for the household selection. Survey interviewers were asked to interview only the pre­selected households. To prevent bias, no replacements and no changes in the pre-selected households were allowed in the implementing stages. All women age 15-49 who slept in the selected households the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed; all men age 15-59 who slept in the households selected for the survey of men were eligible to be interviewed. 

The survey yielded a smaller number of completed interviews for both women and men because there were fewer eligible women and men per household, compared with the census numbers.",Face-to-face,"Three types of questionnaires were administered for the 2008 SLDHS: a) the Household Questionnaire, b) the Women's Questionnaire, and c) the Men's Questionnaire. The contents of these questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS programme for use in countries with low levels of contraceptive use. The SSL, in collaboration with other stakeholders and ICF Macro staff, held a series of meetings to adapt the model questionnaires to the situation in Sierra Leone regarding relevant issues in population, family planning, HIV/AIDS, and other health issues in Sierra Leone. Given that there are many local languages in Sierra Leone-most of which have no accepted written script, and are not taught in the schools-and given that English is widely spoken, it was decided not to attempt to translate the questionnaires into vernaculars. However, many of the questions were 'broken down' to generate a list of key words and translated into the main languages using Roman script. A list with the key words was provided to each interviewer with suggestions for using it during data collection to standardize the translation; this aspect was emphasized during the main training. The household and individual questionnaires were pretested in February 2008. 

a) The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected households. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on the characteristics of the household dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor and roof, ownership of various durable goods, and ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Household Questionnaire was also used to record height and weight measurements of women age 15­49 and children under the age of 5 years, and women's and men's voluntary consent to give blood samples for testing. The HIV and anaemia testing procedures are described in detail in the next section. 

b) The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49 years and covered the following topics: 
- Background characteristics (education, residential history, media exposure, etc.) 
- Reproductive history and child mortality 
- Knowledge and use of family planning methods 
- Fertility preferences 
- Antenatal and delivery care 
- Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
- Vaccinations and childhood illnesses 
- Marriage and sexual activity 
- Woman's work and husband's background characteristics 
- Infant and child feeding practices 
- Awareness and behaviour about AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
- Other health issues 
- Female genital cutting 
- Adult mortality including maternal mortality 

c) The Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 living in every second household in the 2008 SLDHS sample. The Men's Questionnaire collected much the same information found in the Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain questions on reproductive history or maternal and child health and nutrition.","TRAINING OF FIELD STAFF 

Two hundred qualified candidates were recruited for training by Statistics Sierra Leone to serve as supervisors, field editors, interviewers, bio-marker technicians, and quality control personnel. Efforts were made to recruit high-calibre personnel nationwide to ensure appropriate linguistic and cultural diversity. The main survey training was conducted by Statistics Sierra Leone during a four-week period from 17 March to 15 April, 2008. The training was conducted by senior staff from Statistics Sierra Leone, who participated in the pretest, with support from UNFPA, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, and ICF Macro. Training consisted of lectures, demonstrations, practice interviews in small groups, and examinations. The last week of training provided instruction on how to take anthropometric measurements and the procedures for anaemia and HIV testing-how to administer informed consent, how to take blood spot samples, how to dry the filter papers, and how to pack them up the next morning. During the final week of training, participants had two days of field practice. The final day of training consisted of a session with the team supervisors and field editors to train them on how to supervise the fieldwork and how to edit completed questionnaires. 

MAIN FIELDWORK (DATA COLLECTION) 

Fieldwork for the 2008 SLDHS took place over a two-month period from the end of April to the end of June 2008. Twenty-four teams carried out the data collection. Each team consisted of a team supervisor, one field editor, one bio-marker technician, two female interviewers, and one male interviewer. 

HAEMOGLOBIN TESTING 

Haemoglobin testing is the primary method of anaemia diagnosis. Reliable measures are obtained using the HemoCue system (Hb 201+). In half of the households selected for the 2008 SLDHS, men age 15-59, women age 15-49, and children age 6-59 months were tested for anaemia. A consent statement was read to all eligible respondents or to the parent or responsible adult for children and young women age 15-17. This statement explained the purpose of the test, informed them that the results would be made available as soon as the test was completed, and requested permission for the test to be carried out. 

Before taking any blood, the finger was wiped with an alcohol swab and allowed to air dry. Then, the palm side of the end of a finger was punctured with a sterile, single-use, self-retracting lancet. A drop3 of blood was collected in a HemoCue microcuvette, which also serves as a measuring device, and placed in a HemoCue photometer where the results are displayed. An informative brochure was given to each household explaining what anaemia is, the symptoms, and measures people can take to prevent anaemia. Each person whose haemoglobin level was lower than the recommended cut-off point was given a written referral recommending immediate follow-up with a health professional. 

HIV TESTING

All eligible women age 15-49 and men age 15-59 (in every second household) who were interviewed were asked to voluntarily provide three drops of blood for HIV testing. The protocol for the blood specimen collection and analysis was based on the anonymous linked protocol developed by the DHS programme and approved by ICF Macro's Institutional Review Board. The protocol for the SLDHS was also reviewed and approved by the Sierra Leone National Ethics Committee on Bio-Medical Research. The protocol allows for the merging of the HIV results with the socio-demographic data collected in the individual questionnaires, provided that information which could potentially identify an individual is destroyed before the linking is effected. This requires that identification codes be deleted from the data file and that the back page of the Household Questionnaire, which contains the bar code labels and names of respondents, be destroyed prior to merging the HIV results with the individual data file. 

For the purposes of blood sample collection, to obtain informed consent for collecting blood for HIV testing, interviewers explained the procedures, the confidentiality of the data, the fact that test results could not be linked or made available to the subject, and informed respondents how they could establish their HIV status through voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services. Interviewers then collected a dried blood spot sample on a filter paper card from a finger prick using a single-use, spring-loaded, sterile lancet. Each blood sample was given a bar code label, with a duplicate label attached to the Household Questionnaire on the line showing consent for that respondent. A third copy of the same bar code label was affixed to a Blood Sample Transmittal Form to track the blood sample from the field to the laboratory. The filter papers were dried overnight in a plastic drying box, after which they were packed in individual ziploc bags with desiccants and a humidity indicator card, then placed in a larger airtight bag for each sample point. Blood samples were periodically collected in the field along with the completed questionnaires and transported to SSL headquarters in Freetown to be logged in. After this, they were taken to the National Reference Laboratory of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation at Lakka Hospital for HIV testing. 

At the laboratory, the bar code labels on the dried blood spot samples were scanned into the computer using a programme specially developed by ICF Macro that pre-assigns to each sample a sequential number for ease in tracking. The blood spots were kept refrigerated or frozen depending on how long it would be until they could be tested. After the samples were allowed to attain room temperature, a circle-i.e., a completely filled and well-saturated spot without blood clot-at least 6.3 mm in diameter was taken from each filter paper using a hole punch. Each blot was placed into its pre-assigned well in the elution plate that contained 200 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3­7.4) and left in the refrigerator overnight at 2-8°C. These eluates were then diluted and tested with Vironostika HIV Uniform II Plus O (BioMerieux). All positive samples and 10 percent of negative samples were then tested with Murex HIV 1.2.O test kit (Abbott). Finally, any discordant samples were tested on Western Blot 2.2 (Abbott) to resolve the discrepancies. 

Prior to the survey, the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) had experience using its ELISA machine for testing for HIV. ICF Macro supplied the NRL staff with the necessary equipment and reagents. ICF Macro consultants visited and worked with the NRL staff and trained seven laboratory technicians in how to run the various tests and use the software. The HIV test results were merged with the individual questionnaire records after the questionnaires were destroyed and the cluster numbers scrambled.",,"[{'name': 'Statistics Sierra Leone', 'abbreviation': 'SSL', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The response rates are lower in the urban than rural sample, especially for men.

The sample of respondents selected in the SLDHS 2008 is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results. 

A sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design. 

If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the SLDHS 2008 sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex formulae. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the SLDHS 2008 is a Macro SAS procedure. This procedure used the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for variance estimation of more complex statistics such as fertility and mortality rates. 

The Jackknife repeated replication method derives estimates of complex rates from each of several replications of the parent sample, and calculates standard errors for these estimates using simple formulae. Each replication considers all but one cluster in the calculation of the estimates. Pseudo-independent replications are thus created. In the SLDHS 2008, there were 353 non-empty clusters. Hence, 353 replications were created. 

In addition to the standard error, the design effect (DEFT) for each estimate is calculated, which is defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used. A DEFT value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a value greater than 1.0 indicates the increase in the sampling error due to the use of a more complex and less statistically efficient design. The relative standard error and confidence limits for the estimates are also calculated. 

Sampling errors for the SLDHS 2008 are calculated for selected variables considered to be of primary interest for the women's survey and for the men's surveys, respectively. The results are presented in this appendix for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas, for each of the four geographical regions. For each variable, the type of statistic (mean, proportion, or rate) and the base population are given in Table B.1. Tables B.2 to B.8 present the value of the statistic (R), its standard error (SE), the number of unweighted (N-UNWE) and weighted (N-WEIG) cases, the design effect (DEFT), the relative standard error (SE/R), and the 95 percent confidence limits (R±2SE), for each variable. The DEFT is considered undefined when the standard error considering simple random sample is zero (when the estimate is close to 0 or 1). In the case of the total fertility rate and total abortion rate, the number of unweighted cases is not relevant, as there is no known unweighted value for woman-years of exposure to child-bearing. 

The confidence interval (e.g., as calculated for children ever born to women aged 40-49) can be interpreted as follows: the overall average from the national sample is 5.538 and its standard error is 0.114. Therefore, to obtain the 95 percent confidence limits, one adds and subtracts twice the standard error to the sample estimate, i.e., 5.538±2×0.114. There is a high probability (95 percent) that the true average number of children ever born to all women aged 40 to 49 is between 5.310 and 5.766. 

For the total sample, the value of the DEFT, averaged over all variables, is 1.5. This means that, due to multi-stage clustering of the sample, the average standard error is increased by a factor of 1.5 over that in an equivalent simple random sample.","Nonsampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the 2008 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS 2008) to minimize this type of error, nonsampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically.",,,,

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A dwelling unit may be defined as any structure; permanent, semi permanent or traditional where people live and sleep. It may be a hut, house, stores with a sleeping room or rooms at the back or sides, a shelter of reeds/straw such as those used by fishermen, or any other structure where people sleep.
- Households: A household consists of one or more persons, related or unrelated, who live together and make common provision for food. They regularly take all their food from the same pot, and/or share the same grain store (nkhokwe) or pool their incomes for the purpose of purchasing food. Persons in a household may live in one or more dwelling units.
- Group quarters: Collective household refers to a large group of people who live together and sharing common facilities such as kitchen, toilet, lounge, and dormitories. In such situation the residents may not have complete independent quarters that qualify as housing units as their living quarters during the census period.","All persons present in Malawi at the time of census.

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A building is an independent free-standing structure irrespective of its construction material, composed of one or more rooms.
- Households: A household consists of a person or a group of persons who live together in the same housing unit or part of it and who consider themselves as one unit in terms of the provision of food and/or other essentials of living for the group.  When most of the members of such a group are related by blood (i.e., biologically) the group shall be referred to as a Private Household for the purpose of the census.  On the other hand when the group (i.e., household as defined earlier) consists of members who are not related by blood and they are more than 10, they will be considered as Non-Institutional Collective Household.  Note that if the group consists of 10 or less members, it should be considered a private household.
- Group quarters: An institution is usually a set of premises used to house a large number of people who are not related by blood or marriage but bound together by a common objective or personal interest (e.g., universities, boarding houses, hospitals, army barracks, camps, prisons, hotels, etc.)",Residents of Sudan,Census/enumeration data [cen],,"[{'name': 'Sudan', 'abbreviation': 'SDN'}]",,"[{'topic': 'Technical Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: Global Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Technical Person Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Demographic Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Group Quarters Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: M-Z Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Utilities Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Appliances, Mechanicals, Other Amenities Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Dwelling Characteristics Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Other Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Nativity and Birthplace Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Family Interrelationship Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Fertility and Mortality Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Education Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Work Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Disability Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Migration Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Household Economic Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Household Imputation Flags Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Work: Occupation Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Work: Industry Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Person Imputation Flags Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}]","[{'start': '2008-04-22', 'end': '2008-05-06', 'cycle': ''}]","MICRODATA SOURCE: Central Bureau of Statistics

RIDHS collected the indicators on fertility, family planning and maternal and child health which the survey normally provides. In addition, RIDHS integrated a malaria module and tests for the prevalence of malaria and anemia among women and children, thus determining the prevalence of malaria and anemia for women and children at the national level.

The main objectives of the RIDHS were:
• At the national level, gather data to determine demographic rates, particularly fertility and infant and child mortality rates, and analyze the direct and indirect factors that determine fertility and child mortality rates and trends.
• Evaluate the level of knowledge and use of contraceptives among women and men.
• Gather data concerning family health: vaccinations; prevalence and treatment of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections (ARI), and fever in children under the age of five; antenatal care visits; and assistance during childbirth.
• Gather data concerning the prevention and treatment of malaria, particularly the possession and use of mosquito nets, and the prevention of malaria in pregnant women.
• Gather data concerning child feeding practices, including breastfeeding.
• Gather data concerning circumcision among men between the ages of 15 and 59.
• Collect blood samples in all of the households surveyed for anemia testing of women age 15-49, pregnant women and children under age five.

- HOUSEHOLD: this questionnaire was used to list usual members and visitors in selected households.In addition ,some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed such as sex, age, education and relationship to the head of household.The main objective of the household questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for individual interview.

- WOMEN: Women's questionnaire was used to collect information on women of productive age ( 15-49 years) and this includes: background characteristics, marital status,birth history,knowledge and use of family planning methods,fertility preferences,antenatal and deliver care,breastfeeding practices,vaccinations and childhood illness.

- MEN: The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households.

In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.","[{'name': 'Rwanda', 'abbreviation': 'RWA'}]","[{'keyword': 'Demographics', 'vocab': '', 'uri': ''}, {'keyword': 'Population', 'vocab': '', 'uri': ''}, {'keyword': 'Health', 'vocab': '', 'uri': ''}]","[{'topic': 'Health', 'vocab': 'World Bank', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Education', 'vocab': 'World Bank', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Poverty', 'vocab': 'World Bank', 'uri': ''}]","[{'start': '2007-12', 'end': '2008-04', 'cycle': '4 months'}]","The sample for the RIDHS is a two-stage stratified area sample. Clusters are the primary sampling units and are constituted from enumeration areas (EA). The EA were defined in the 2002 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH) (SNR, 2005). 

These enumeration areas provided the master frame for the drawing of 250 clusters (187 rural and 63 urban), selected with a representative probability proportional to their size. Only 249 of these clusters were surveyed, because one cluster located in a refugee camp had to be eliminated from the sample. A strictly proportional sample allocation would have resulted in a very low number of urban households in certain provinces. It was therefore necessary to slightly oversample urban areas in order to survey a sufficient number of households to produce reliable estimates for urban areas. The second stage involved selecting a sample of households in these enumeration areas. In order to adequately guarantee the accuracy of the indicators, the total number drawn was limited to 30 households per cluster. Because of the nonproportional distribution of the sample among the different strata and the fact that the number of households was set for each cluster, weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.

All women age 15-49 years who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed (7,528 women). In addition, a sample of men age 15-59 who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible for the survey (7,168 men). Finally, all women age 15-49 and all children under the age of five were eligible for the anemia and malaria diagnostic tests.

The sample for the 2007-08 RIDHS covered the population residing in ordinary households across the country. A national sample of 7,469 households (1,863 in urban areas and 5,606 in rural areas) was selected. The sample was first stratified to provide adequate representation from urban and rural areas as well as all the four provinces and the city of Kigali, the nation’s capital.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Three questionnaires were used in the 2007-08 RIDHS: the Household Questionnaire, the Women’s Questionnaire, and the Men’s Questionnaire. The content of these questionnaires was based on model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS project.

Initial technical meetings that were held beginning in September 2007 allowed a wide range of government agencies as well as local and international organizations to contribute to the development of the questionnaires. Based on these discussions, the DHS model questionnaires were modified to reflect the needs of users and relevant issues in population, family planning, anemia, malaria and other health concerns in Rwanda. The questionnaires were then translated from French into Kinyarwanda. These questionnaires were finalized in December 2007 before the training of male and female interviewers.

The Household Questionnaire was used to list all of the usual members and visitors in the selected households. In addition, some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household’s dwelling unit such as the main source of drinking water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, the main energy source used for cooking and ownership of various durable goods. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women and children eligible for the hemoglobin (anemia) and malaria diagnostic tests.

The Women’s Questionnaire was used to collect information on women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and covered questions on the following topics:
• Background characteristics
• Marital status
• Birth history
• Knowledge and use of family planning methods
• Fertility preferences
• Antenatal and delivery care
• Breastfeeding practices
• Vaccinations and childhood illnesses

The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households. The Men’s Questionnaire collected information similar to that of the Women’s Questionnaire, with the only difference being that it did not include birth history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition. In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.","Training and Data Collection
Staff responsible for the survey at the National Institute of Statistics, in collaboration with the technical team, recruited 70 people to participate in data collection. Training included two phases, theoretical and practical. Three weeks of training were provided, from November 20 to December 11, 2007, including three days of field practicum in urban and rural areas not selected for the survey.

After the training, the field staff were divided into 13 teams, each with a team leader, a supervisor, and three interviewers. A laboratory technician from the National Malaria Control Program was included on each team for the anemia and malaria diagnostic tests. The laboratory technicians were medically qualified to take blood samples and conduct the anemia and malaria test under the supervision of the PNILP technical team with assistance from ICF Macro.

Data collection began on December 15, 2007 in the area of the city of Kigali. This location made it possible to closely monitor the teams before they were dispatched to more distant areas. After two weeks, all teams except one that was needed remaining to complete the work in Kigali were deployed to their respective work zones. Data collection was completed on April 20, 2008.",Weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.,"[{'name': 'National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda', 'abbreviation': 'NISR', 'affiliation': 'Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning'}]","""National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, Rwanda Interim Demographic and Health Survey 2007-2008 (RIDHS 2008), v01, provided by the National Data Archive. http://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/13""",,"Data entry began on January 7, 2008, three weeks after the beginning of data collection activities in the field.

Completed questionnaires were periodically brought in from the field to the National Institute of Statistics in Kigali, where assigned staff checked them and coded the open-ended questions. Next, the questionnaires were sent to the data entry staff. Data were entered using CSPro, a program developed jointly by the United States Census Bureau, the ICF Macro MEASURE DHS program, and Serpro S.A. All questionnaires were entered twice to eliminate as many data entry errors as possible from the files.

Nonsampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the 2007-08 RIDHS to minimize this type of error, nonsampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically.

Sampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents selected in the 2007-08 RIDHS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results.

A sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design.

If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2007-08 RIDHS sample is the result of a multistage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex formula. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the 2007-08 RIDHS is a macro SAS procedure. This procedure used the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for variance estimation of more complex statistics such as fertility and mortality rates.

The Taylor linearization method treats any percentage or average as a ratio estimate, r = y/x, where y represents the total sample value for variable y, and x represents the total number of cases in the group or subgroup under consideration.

The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. 

The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  

The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: 

- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates 
- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality 
- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region 
- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use 
- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices 
- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding 
- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children 
- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates 
- To collect information on the extent of disability 
- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. 

MAIN RESULTS

- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. 

- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. 

- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  

- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. 

- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.

- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. 

- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). 

- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. 

- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.

- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.","The sample of the 2006 UDHS was designed to allow separate estimates at the national level and for urban and rural areas of the country. The sample design also allowed for specific indicators, such as contraceptive use, to be calculated for each of nine sub-national regions. Portions of the northern region were oversampled in order to provide estimates for two special areas of interest: Karamoja and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.

A representative probability sample of 9,864 households was selected for the 2006 UDHS survey. The sample was selected in two stages. In the first stage, 321 clusters were selected from among a list of clusters sampled in the 2005-2006 Uganda National Household Survey (UBOS, 2006c). This matching of samples was conducted in order to allow for linking of 2006 UDHS health indicators to poverty data from the 2005-2006 UNHS. The clusters from the Uganda National Household Survey were in turn selected from the 2002 Census sample frame. For the UDHS 2006, an additional 17 clusters were selected from the 2002 Census frame in Karamoja in order to increase the sample size to allow for reporting of Karamoja­specific estimates in the UDHS. Finally, 30 IDP camps were selected from a list of camps compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (UN OCHA) as of July 2005, completing a total of 368 primary sampling units. Figure 1.1 shows the geographical distribution of the 368 clusters visited in the 2006 UDHS. 

In the second stage, households in each cluster were selected based on a complete listing of households. In the 321 clusters that were included in the UNHS sample, the lists of households used were those generated during the UNHS listing operations April-August 2005. The UNHS sampled ten households per cluster. All ten were purposively included in the UDHS sample. An additional 15 to 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. The 17 additional clusters in Karamoja were listed, and 27 households were selected in each cluster. The selected IDP camps were divided into segments because of their large size, and one segment selected in each camp. Then a listing operation was carried out in the selected segment, and 30 households were selected in each camp from the segment of the map that was listed. All women age 15-49 who were either permanent residents of the households in the 2006 UDHS sample or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed. In addition, in a sub-sample of one-third of all the households selected for the survey, all men age 15-54 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey. Indicators such as total fertility rate, childhood mortality rates, and the maternal mortality ratio require a larger sample size than other indicators. These indicators are all calculated from the data provided by female respondents only. For this reason, the number of male respondents required in the sample to obtain acceptable precision in estimates of desired indicators is lower than the number of female respondents. 

Biomarkers collected in the UDHS included height and weight measurements for children under 6 years, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; anaemia testing in children age 6 to 59 months old, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; and dried blood spot collection for vitamin A testing in children age 6 to 59 months old and women age 15 to 49 years. All of these biomarkers were measured only in those households selected for the male interview-that is, one in three households. 

COMPARABILITY OF THE 2006 UDHS SAMPLE WITH SAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS UDHS SURVEYS 

The 2006 UDHS is the first UDHS to include the entire country in the sample. In previous surveys, it was necessary to exclude groups of districts because of security problems. In the 2000-2001 UDHS, areas making up the current districts of Amuru, Bundibugyo, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, and Pader were excluded from the sample. According to the 2002 Census, these areas comprise around 7 percent of the population of Uganda (UBOS 2006a). The 1995 UDHS excluded Kitgum and Pader, while the 1988­1989 UDHS excluded most of the Northern region. 

To show trends using comparable data, the 2006 UDHS data were run without the districts that were excluded in previous surveys. For some key indicators, the report presents two estimates from the 2006 data: one covering the entire country, and a second covering the geographic area surveyed in the 2000-2001 UDHS. Differences between these two estimates are small, seldom exceeding one or two percentage points. 

Because it was not possible to run every indicator twice, the report includes many comparisons between the 2000-2001 and 2006 surveys in which the 2006 data have not been adjusted. The report states explicitly when the 2006 data presented are adjusted; otherwise, the data are unadjusted. Comparisons that include unadjusted 2006 data should be interpreted with caution.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used for the 2006 UDHS, namely, the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, and the Men's Questionnaire. The contents of these questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires for the MEASURE DHS program. In consultation with technical institutions and local organizations, UBOS adapted these questionnaires to reflect population and health issues relevant in Uganda. The revized questionnaires were translated from English into six local languages, namely, Ateso/Karamojong, Luganda, Lugbara, Luo, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The questionnaires were pretested prior to their finalization in January and February of 2006. 

a) The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected households. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. For children under age 18, survival status of the parents was determined. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, ownership of various durable goods, and ownership and use of mosquito nets. Care and support services received by orphans and other vulnerable children and disability status of household members were also collected in the Household Questionnaires. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was used to document the respondents' decision as to whether to volunteer to give blood samples for vitamin A deficiency (VAD) testing as well as to record the height, weight, and haemoglobin measurements of women age 15-49 years, men age 15-54 years, and children age 6-59 months in those households selected for these measurements.  

b) The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49. These women were asked questions on the following topics: 
- Background characteristics (education, residential history, media exposure, etc.) 
- Birth history and childhood mortality 
- Knowledge and use of family planning methods 
- Fertility preferences 
- Antenatal and childbirth care 
- Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
- Vaccinations and childhood illnesses 
- Marriage and sexual activity 
- Woman's work and husband's background characteristics 
- Awareness and behavior regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
- Maternal mortality 
- Domestic violence.  

c) The Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-54  living in every third household in the 2006 UDHS sample. The Men's Questionnaire collected much of the same information found in the Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain a detailed reproductive history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition, or maternal mortality.","TRAINING OF FIELD STAFF 

UBOS recruited and trained staff to serve as supervisors, field editors, male and female interviewers, field coordinators, and health technicians. They all participated in the main interviewer training held in Entebbe April 2-28. UBOS, Macro, and invited experts from government ministries led the four-week training that included lectures, presentations, practical demonstrations, and practice interviewing in small groups, as well as two days of field practice. Participants were shown brands of contraceptives, vitamin A and iron folate supplements, and common antimalaria drugs, and they were taught how to test salt for iodine using test kits provided by UNICEF. During the training, special attention was paid to identifying brands of mosquito nets. Information sheets with photos of net material and net labels developed by the Malaria Consortium were presented and distributed to the trainees. Samples of common brands of nets were also shown. Salt samples were also tested for their iodine levels. The health technicians received training in anthropometry, hemoglobin testing, and the collection of dried blood spot (DBS) samples from a finger prick for the vitamin A deficiency (VAD) testing.  

COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION 

Before and during fieldwork for the 2006 UDHS, a community mobilization programme was implemented by a multi-disciplinary team of members from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Health, and the Population Secretariat. The objective of the community mobilization was to sensitize the respondents regarding the survey, including key topics in the questionnaires and the issue of drawing blood in order to maximize participation. It was stressed that the blood sample was not for HIV-AIDS testing. 

Seven groups of two officials were deployed to the districts. Before their arrivals, the Ministry of Health sent an advance letter requesting all District Directors of Health Services to identify the community mobilization coordinators for the respective districts. Together with the district coordinators and reporters from local media houses, the teams went to the sub-counties in which the enumeration areas (EAs) were located. At the sub-county, local officials were engaged to conduct community mobilization in the enumeration areas. The teams sent from the national level also visited a number of enumeration areas together with the local community mobilizers. In each EA, community mobilization was done one week before the data collection teams arrived. In Kampala city, additional sensitization was done through the use of Ministry of Health film vans that moved around the enumeration areas spreading out the message and providing a number of advocacy materials.  

FIELDWORK 

Fifteen data collection teams consisting of three female interviewers, one male interviewer, a supervisor, a field editor, a health technician, and a driver began fieldwork on May 5, 2006. Fieldwork was completed in the first week of October 2006. Fieldwork supervision was coordinated from UBOS headquarters; four regional coordinators routinely visited teams to review their work and monitor data quality. Additionally, the UBOS headquarters and the teams maintained close contact through field visits by senior staff and Macro International staff. Regular communication was also maintained through cell phones. Teams implemented community mobilization in the sampled clusters to raise awareness of the nature and purpose of the study. Fieldwork was carried out in five separate field trips. Between trips, all teams met in Kampala to discuss problems with fieldwork logistics or data collection and to receive feedback and training reinforcement from UBOS staff. 

A regular schedule was established in order to retrieve questionnaires and blood samples from the field. Dried blood spot samples for VAD were dried overnight in light-proof boxes and then stored in portable refrigerators run on the vehicle batteries in order to prevent degradation of retinol binding protein (RBP) in the samples. Blood samples were brought in from the field and transported to the laboratory at the Biochemistry Department at Makerere University, where they were stored in a -20 C freezer until they were tested.",,"[{'name': 'Uganda Bureau of Statistics', 'abbreviation': 'UBOS', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Completed questionnaires were returned periodically from the field to the UBOS data processing center, first in Entebbe and later in Kampala, where they were entered and edited by 15 data processing personnel who were specially trained for this task. The data processing personnel included a supervisor, a questionnaire administrator (who kept track of the questionnaires received from each cluster), an office editor, data entry operators, and a secondary editor. The concurrent processing of the data was an advantage since field check tables monitored various data quality parameters. As a result, the teams got specific feedback to improve performance. The data entry and editing phase of the survey was completed in mid-October 2006.","[{'name': 'MEASURE DHS', 'affiliation': 'ICF International', 'email': 'archive@measuredhs.com', 'uri': 'www.measuredhs.com'}]",,"[{'name': 'Macro International Inc', 'affiliation': '', 'role': 'Technical assistance'}]",,,"[{'name': 'UK Department for International Development', 'abbreviation': 'DfID', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'U.S. Agency for International Development', 'abbreviation': 'USAID', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief', 'abbreviation': 'PEPFAR', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'Government of Uganda', 'abbreviation': '', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'Health Partnership Fund', 'abbreviation': 'HPF', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'United Nations Children’s Fund', 'abbreviation': 'UNICEF', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'United Nations Population Fund', 'abbreviation': 'UNFPA', 'role': 'Funding'}, {'name': 'Government of Japan', 'abbreviation': '', 'role': 'Funding'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",,,,,,DHS 2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents selected in the 2006 UDHS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results.  

A sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design. 

If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2006 UDHS sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex formulae. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the 2006 UDHS is the ISSA Sampling Error Module. This module used the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for the square root of the variance.

The Jackknife repeated replication method derives estimates of complex rates from each of several replications of the parent sample, and calculates standard errors for these estimates using simple formulae. Each replication considers all but one clusters in the calculation of the estimates. Pseudo-independent replications are thus created. In the 2006 UDHS, there were 368 non-empty clusters. Hence, 368 replications were created. 

In addition to the standard error, ISSA computes the design effect (DEFT) for each estimate, which is defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used. A DEFT value of 1.0 indicates that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a value greater than indicates the increase in the sampling error due to the use of a more complex and less statistically efficient design. ISSA also computes the relative error and confidence limits for the estimates. 

Sampling errors for the 2006 UDHS are calculated for selected variables considered to be of primary interest for the women's survey and for the men's survey. The results are presented in an appendix to the Final report for the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas, and for each of the nine sub-domains. For each variable, the type of statistic (mean, proportion, or rate) and the base population are given in Table B.1 of the Final report. Tables B.2 to B.13 present the value of the statistic (R), its standard error (SE), the number of unweighted (N) and weighted (WN) cases, the design effect (DEFT), the relative standard error (SE/R), and the 95 percent confidence limits (R±2SE), for each variable. The DEFT is considered undefined when the standard error for a simple random sample is zero (when the estimate is close to 0 or 1). In the case of the total fertility rate, the number of unweighted cases is not relevant, as there is no known unweighted value for woman-years of exposure to child-bearing. 

The confidence interval (e.g., as calculated for children ever born to women age 40-49) can be interpreted as follows: the overall average from the national sample is 7.318 and its standard error is 0.101. Therefore, to obtain the 95 percent confidence limits, one adds and subtracts twice the standard error to the sample estimate, i.e., 7.318 ± 2 × 0.101. There is a high probability (95 percent) that the true average number of children ever born to all women age 40 to 49 is between 7.116 and 7.519. 

In general, the relative standard error for most estimates for the country as a whole is small, except for estimates of very small proportions. There are differentials in the relative standard error for the estimates of sub-populations. For example, for the variable contraceptive use for currently married women, the relative standard errors as a percent of the estimated mean for the whole country, for the urban areas and for the rural areas are 3.3 percent, 5.3 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. 

For the total sample, the value of the design effect (DEFT), averaged over all selected variables, is 1.305 which means that, due to multi-stage clustering of the sample, the average standard error is increased by a factor of 1.305 over that in an equivalent simple random sample.",,,,,

Hence, the majority of household interviews were from these resident populations with only a small subsample of IDP households in the six economic zones. Separate samples were drawn by WFP VAM-HQ from each group for the survey.

A list of all communities and their populations in the economic zones of Guba-Kachmaz, Daglig-Shirvan, Sheki-Zagatala, Aran (divided into Kur and Orta-Kur), Ganja-Gazakh and Lankaran-Astara was provided by WFP Azerbaijan. Not covered were Nakhchivan an isolated zone surrounded by Turkey, Iran and Armenia, the occupied area of Nagorno-Karabakh and the occupied districts surrounding it, and the Absheron peninsula, which is sparsely populated except for the greater Baku area. Exceptions were the two districts Tartar and Khyzy -Tartar officially belonging to the occupied economic zone is covered under the Orta-Kur sub-sample and Khyzy, officially belonging to the Absheron peninsula, is covered under Guba-Kachmaz.

A two-stage cluster sampling was applied; the first stage was to draw a sample of 20, 30 or 40 clusters (in total 210 clusters) depending  on the population size of each zone or sub-zone. The second stage was to randomly select 12 to 15 households in each sampled community using interval sampling based upon the physical distribution of households within a grid. A total of 3,078 households were interviewed, which included 27 IDP-households that lived mixed with local residents. The sample allows comparisons between Economic Zones but is not precisely representative of the population.

The majority of IDP settlements are located in 13 districts. As it was difficult to obtain a reliable sampling frame indicating the location of IDP-settlements, it was decided to draw a purposive sample based upon the settlement type. Hence, the results are not statistically representative and should rather serve as estimates to describe in general the food security situation of IDPs in the country.

At the time of the survey only one railway camp still existed, the sample size is therefore rather small for this category. It should also be noted that many households categorized as dugouts, now live in small basic mud-brick houses located next to their former underground dwellings where they now keep livestock. It was still decided to treat these households as a separate category as they reside in a distinct geographic area; it can also be assumed that their former livelihoods as herders still determine many aspects of their current situation and livelihood opportunities.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The household questionnaire was developed to collect quantitative information on household demography, housing and amenities, household and animal assets, income sources & contribution, agriculture, expenditures; food consumption, food sufficiency, exposure to risks & shocks and coping strategies, maternal and child health and nutrition.

For maternal anthropometry, height and weight were measured for non-pregnant women while weight and length/height were measured on children less than 5 years of age. This information would be used to calculate nutritional indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight and BMI).

Although beyond the purpose of this study, the results of Rural Kagera CWIQ could be set against those of other CWIQ surveys that have been implemented in other districts of Tanzania: Mbeya Urban District, Singida Urban District and Mtwara Urban District. African countries that have implemented nationally representative CWIQ surveys include
Malawi, Ghana and Kenya.",,,"The Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) currently constitutes one of the largest socio-economic household survey databases on Tanzania. Since 2003 EDI has interviewed roughly 20,000 households in 35 different districts. For 9 districts repeat surveys have been organised to track changes over time.

Rationale: Absence of district level survey data does not rhyme with the devolution of power to districts. Tanzania is undergoing a decentralisation process whereby each of its roughly 128 districts is becoming an increasingly important policy actor. A district taking on this challenge needs accurate information to monitor and develop its own policies. Much relevant information is currently not available as national statistics are not representative at district level and many of the routine data collection mechanisms are still under development. CWIQ then provides an attractive, one-stop survey-based method to collect basic development indicators. Furthermore, the survey results can be disseminated - through Swahili briefs and posters - to a district's population; thus increasing the extent to which people are able to hold their local governments accountable. Exciting new ground is being broken on such population-wide dissemination by the Prime Minister's Office.

Methodology: The data are collected through a small 10-page questionnaire, called the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ). The questionnaire and data software constitute an off-the-shelf survey package developed by the World Bank to produce standardised monitoring indicators of welfare. The questionnaire is purposively concise and is designed to collect information on household demographics, employment, education, health and nutrition as well as utilisation and satisfaction with social services. Questionnaires are scannable, with interviewers shading bubbles and writing numbers later recognised by the scanning software. The data system is fully automated allowing the results to roll out within weeks of the fieldwork.

Funding: projects are typically funded by organisations that care about making decentralisation work in Tanzania. CWIQ is a method to promote evidence-based policy formulation and debate in the district and a tool for the population to hold their local governments accountable. With funding from the RNE (Royal Netherlands Embassy) and SNV (Stichting Nederlands Vrijwilligers), CWIQ surveys were implemented between 2003-2005 in 16 districts. In 2006/07 PMO-RALG (Prime Minister's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government) commissioned EDI to cover a further 28 districts. In 9 of these districts this constituted a repeat survey and thus a unique opportunity arises to monitor changes that occurred in the district over this time period. 

Dissemination: EDI disseminated the results of CWIQ on posters and briefs to district level stakeholders (councillors, district officials, NGOs, CBOs, Advocacy Groups, MPs, 'interested citizens', etc.), with the aim at district level, to: (i) promote evidence-based policy debate, (ii) promote evidence-based policy formulation, (iii) provide tools for district level M&E and (iv) increase accountability of LGA to citizens. 

Public Domain: Currently in the public domain are (i) all CWIQ reports - note that Shinyanga 2004 and Kagera 2003 reports are organised into one region-wide report (ii) Swahili and English briefs for 5 pilot dissemination districts funded by the Prime Minister's Office - and (iii) raw data for all CWIQs conducted between 2003 and 2007.","Five rural districts of Kagera: Ngara, Biharamulo, Muleba, Bukoba Rural and Karagwe.","- Households

Survey Objectives 
The 2006 Palestinian Refugee Camps, Lebanon Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives: 
- To provide up-to-date information for assessing the situation of children and women in Generic 
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration, the goals of A World Fit For Children (WFFC), and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action; 
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Generic and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems. 

Survey Content 

MICS questionnaires are designed in a modular fashion that can be easily customized to the needs of a country. They consist of a household questionnaire, a questionnaire for women aged 15-49 and a questionnaire for children under the age of five (to be administered to the mother or caretaker). Other than a set of core modules, countries can select which modules they want to include in each questionnaire. 

Survey Implementation 

The surveys are typically carried out by government organizations, with the support and assistance of UNICEF and other partners. Technical assistance and training for the surveys is provided through a series of regional workshops, covering questionnaire content, sampling and survey implementation; data processing; data quality and data analysis; report writing and dissemination. 

Survey results 

Results from the surveys, including national reports, standard sets of tabulations and micro level datasets will all be made widely available after completion of the surveys. Results from the surveys will also be made available in DevInfo format. DevInfo v5.0 is a powerful database system which has been adapted from UNICEF's ChildInfo technology to specifically monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.

Details of each of these steps can be found in the data processing documentation, data editing guidelines, data processing programs in CSPro and SPSS, and tabulation guidelines. 

Data entry was conducted by 12 data entry operators in tow shifts, supervised by 2 data entry supervisors, using a total of 7 computers (6 data entry computers plus one supervisors computer). All data entry was conducted at the GenCenStat head office using manual data entry. For data entry, CSPro version 2.6.007 was used with a highly structured data entry program, using system controlled approach, that controlled entry of each variable. All range checks and skips were controlled by the program and operators could not override these. A limited set of consistency checks were also included inthe data entry program. In addition, the calculation of anthropometric Z-scores was also included in the data entry programs for use during analysis. Open-ended responses (""Other"" answers) were not entered or coded, except in rare circumstances where the response matched an existing code in the questionnaire. 

Structure and completeness checking ensured that all questionnaires for the cluster had been entered, were structurally sound, and that women's and children's questionnaires existed for each eligible woman and child. 

100% verification of all variables was performed using independent verification, i.e. double entry of data, with separate comparison of data followed by modification of one or both datasets to correct keying errors by original operators who first keyed the files. 

After completion of all processing in CSPro, all individual cluster files were backed up before concatenating data together using the CSPro file concatenate utility. 

For tabulation and analysis SPSS versions 10.0 and 14.0 were used. Version 10.0 was originally used for all tabulation programs, except for child mortality. Later version 14.0 was used for child mortality, data quality tabulations and other analysis activities. 

After transferring all files to SPSS, certain variables were recoded for use as background characteristics in the tabulation of the data, including grouping age, education, geographic areas as needed for analysis. In the process of recoding ages and dates some random imputation of dates (within calculated constraints) was performed to handle missing or ""don't know"" ages or dates. Additionally, a wealth (asset) index of household members was calculated using principal components analysis, based on household assets, and both the score and quintiles were included in the datasets for use in tabulations.","2007, PCBS, The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and Natural Resources",No major deviations from the original sample design were made. All sample enumeration areas were accessed and successfully interviewed with good response rates.,2006-07-20,,,,"The data were collected by 10 teams; each comprised of 4 interviewers, one measurer and a supervisor. 

The role of the supervisor was to coordinator field data collection activities, including management of the field teams, supplies and equipment, finances, maps and listings, coordinate with local authorities concerning the survey plan and make arrangements for accomodation and travel. Additionally, the field supervisor assigned the work to the interviewers, spot checked work, maintained field control documents, and sent completed questionnaires and progress reports to the central office. 

The field editor was responsible for reviewing each questionnaire at the end of the day, checking for missed questions, skip errors, fields incorrectly completed, and checking for inconsistencies in the data. The field editor also observed interviews and conducted review sessions with interviewers. 

Responsibilities of the supervisors and field editors are described in the Instructions for Supervisors and Field Editors, together with the different field controls that were in place to control the quality of the fieldwork. 

Field visits were also made by a team of central staff on a periodic basis during fieldwork. The senior staff of GenCenStat also made 3 visits to field teams to provide support and to review progress.",,,,"Estimates from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: 1) non-sampling errors and 2) sampling errors. Non-sampling errors are the results of mistakes made in the implementation of data collection and data processing. Numerous efforts were made during implementation of the 2006 PLS Lebanon MICS to minimize this type of error, however, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically. 

Sampling errors can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents to the 2006 PLS Lebanon MICS is only one of many possible samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differe somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability in the results of the survey between all possible samples, and, although, the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results. The sampling erros are measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean or percentage), which is the square root of the variance. Confidence intervals are calculated for each statistic within which the true value for the population can be assumed to fall. Plus or minus two standard errors of the statistic is used for key statistics presented in MICS, equivalent to a 95 percent confidence interval. 

If the sample of respondents had been a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulae for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2006 PLS Lebanon MICS sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and consequently needs to use more complex formulae. The SPSS complex samples module has been used to calculate sampling errors for the 2006 PLS Lebanon MICS. This module uses the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. This method is documented in the SPSS file CSDescriptives.pdf found under the Help, Algorithms options in SPSS. 

Sampling errors have been calculated for a select set of statistics (all of which are proportions due to the limitations of the Taylor linearization method) for the total sample, and for each of the 5 governorate. For each statistic, the estimate, its standard error, the coefficient of variation (or relative error -- the ratio between the standard error and the estimate), the design effect, and the square root design effect (DEFT -- the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used), as well as the 95 percent confidence intervals (+/-2 standard errors). 

Details of the sampling errors are presented in the sampling errors appendix to the report and in the sampling errors table presented in te external resources.","A series of data quality tables and graphs are available to review the quality of the data and include the following: 
Age distribution of the household population 
Age distribution of eligible women and interviewed women 
Age distribution of eligible children and children for whom the mother or caretaker was interviewed 
Age distribution of children under age 5 by 3 month groups 
Age and period ratios at boundaries of eligibility 
Percent of observations with missing information on selected variables 
Presence of mother inthe household and person interviewed for the under 5 questionnaire 
School attendance by single year age 
Sex ratio at birth among children ever born, surviving and dead by age of respondent 
Distribution of women by time since last birth 
Scatterplot of weight by height, weight by age and height by age 
Graph of male and female population by single years of age 
Population pyramid 

The results of each of these data quality tables is shown in the appendix of the final report and is also given in the external resources section. 

The general rule for presentation of missing data in the final report tabulations is that a column is presented for missing data if the percentage of cases with missing data is 1% or more. Cases with missing data on the background characteristics (e.g. education) are included in the tables, but the missing data rows are suppressed and noted at the bottom of the tables in the report (not in the SPSS output, however).",,,,

Indicators

The list of global indicators being used to assess progress at end-decade was developed through extensive consultation, both within UNICEF, particularly with Programme Division and the Regional Offices, and with WHO, UNESCO and the ILO. The global indicator list can be found in Annex 1 of the Executive Directive EXD/1999-03 dated 23 April 1999.
 
Mid decade experience

There are numerous sources of data for measuring progress at country level, but many either do not function well enough to give current and quality data, or do not provide the data required for assessing progress. Household surveys are capable of filling many of these data gaps. The mid-decade assessment led to 100 countries collecting data using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), household surveys developed to obtain specific mid-decade data, or via MICS questionnaire modules carried by other surveys. By 1996, 60 developing countries had carried out stand-alone MICS, and another 40 had incorporated some of the MICS modules into other surveys. The mid-decade questionnaire and manual, the countries where a standalone MICS was implemented.
 
The end-decade assessment

The end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual have been developed specifically to obtain the data for 63 of the 75 end-decade indicators. These draw heavily on experiences with the mid-decade MICS and the subsequent MICS evaluation. The content is organized into question modules, for countries to adopt or omit according to the data already available. The development of the end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual has drawn on an even wider spread of organizations than the mid-decade MICS. They include WHO, UNESCO, ILO, UNAIDS, the United Nations Statistical Division, CDC Atlanta, MEASURE (USAID), Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and others.","Data downloaded from MICS2 website (www.childinfo.org) on May 24, 2011",,"The 2000 Azerbaijan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) is a nationally representative survey of households, women, and children.

The sample for the Azerbaijan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was designed as a self-weighted sample to provide estimates of World Summit indicators at the national level and for urban and rural areas. The enumeration areas and the households from the Population Census of 1999 formed the sample frame. An enumeration area comprised about 507 persons on the average. It was thus possible to use enumeration areas directly as primary sampling units (PSUs) for first stage selection. The total sample size for the Azerbaijan MICS was calculated as 6112 households. The average cluster size was determined as 24 households and 254 clusters were selected. The sample was selected in two stages. At the first stage, the 254 clusters were distributed to three domains (the Baku area, other urban areas and rural areas) proportionately according to their size. The enumeration areas in each of the three domains were geographically sorted using the nine zones designated during the Soviet era but still in use in the country, albeit in a more limited fashion. Enumeration areas were selected with probability proportional to size, separately from the three domains. The household lists were updated in each selected enumeration area by using several computerized lists originating from the census, as well as the actual household questionnaires from the census, for the primary reason of including IDP/refugee households in the sample. During the second selection stage, households were systematically selected using a fixed sampling interval. A total of 6166 households were selected. The difference between the number of households selected and the target number of households is attributed to rounding during the selection procedures and the presence of multiple households in the selected households. Full technical details of the MICS sample are included in Appendix A of the final report.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaires for the Azerbaijan MICS were based on the MICS Model Questionnaire with some modifications, additions, and deletions. A household questionnaire was administered in each household, which collected information on household members including sex, age, literacy, marital status, and orphanhood status. The household questionnaire also includes education, child labor, water and sanitation, maternal mortality, and salt iodisation modules, as well as several questions on household amenities. In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women
age 15-49 and children under age five","The field staff was trained in two stages. During 7 days in June 2000 a group of 17 interviewers were trained, to take part as interviewers in the pretest and to participate in the main training and fieldwork as trainers, regional coordinators, supervisors and editors.

Indicators

The list of global indicators being used to assess progress at end-decade was developed through extensive consultation, both within UNICEF, particularly with Programme Division and the Regional Offices, and with WHO, UNESCO and the ILO. The global indicator list can be found in Annex 1 of the Executive Directive EXD/1999-03 dated 23 April 1999.
 
Mid decade experience

There are numerous sources of data for measuring progress at country level, but many either do not function well enough to give current and quality data, or do not provide the data required for assessing progress. Household surveys are capable of filling many of these data gaps. The mid-decade assessment led to 100 countries collecting data using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), household surveys developed to obtain specific mid-decade data, or via MICS questionnaire modules carried by other surveys. By 1996, 60 developing countries had carried out stand-alone MICS, and another 40 had incorporated some of the MICS modules into other surveys. The mid-decade questionnaire and manual, the countries where a standalone MICS was implemented.
 
The end-decade assessment

The end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual have been developed specifically to obtain the data for 63 of the 75 end-decade indicators. These draw heavily on experiences with the mid-decade MICS and the subsequent MICS evaluation. The content is organized into question modules, for countries to adopt or omit according to the data already available. The development of the end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual has drawn on an even wider spread of organizations than the mid-decade MICS. They include WHO, UNESCO, ILO, UNAIDS, the United Nations Statistical Division, CDC Atlanta, MEASURE (USAID), Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and others.","Data downloaded from MICS2 website (www.childinfo.org) on May 24, 2011",,"The Bosnia and Herzegovina Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2000 (B&H MICS 2000) is a nationally representative survey of households, women and children (aged 0 – 18 years). The main objectives of the survey were to provide up-to-date information for assessing the situation of children and women in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of the decade, and to furnish the data needed for monitoring progress toward the goals established at the World Summit for Children and as a basis for future action. Data on breast-feeding and salt iodination are available from previous UNICEF supported surveys. 1-4 Data on the remaining End of Decade Goals are available from other sources and are presented in the Bosnia and Herzegovina End of Decade Report. The B&H MICS 2000 survey covered the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina minus the district of Brèko. This was omitted for sampling and organisational reasons. The survey was carried out in mid 2000 in a joint process with input from two entity field teams, from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. State level and entity level data are presented in this report. The survey sampled 10 772 households across the territory with a very high response rate of 98 percent. A total of 35 571 people lived in the households that responded, making this the largest such survey conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the past ten years.

- CHILDREN: Birth registration and Early learning, Care of illness, Immunization, Anthropometry","[{'name': 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'abbreviation': 'BIH'}]",,,"[{'start': '2000-07', 'end': '2000-09', 'cycle': ''}]","The sample for the survey was designed to provide estimates of the indicators at the national level, for urban and rural areas, and for the two entities - the Federation ofBosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The district of Brèko in the North East corner of the State was not included in the survey, due to organisational and statistical sampling difficulties. Developing a sampling frame was perhaps the single biggest challenge in this survey. The most recent complete census data were from 1991. Subsequently, there had been widespread conflict and massive population movements both within and from the state. A two stage sampling method was used and this is explained in detail in Appendix C of the final report.

 Stage 1 
 
 The geographical area of Bosnia and Herzegovina (with the exception of Brèko district) was selected. The enumeration areas from the 1991 census were taken as the basis for developing the sampling frame. This was updated in the Federation using three additional sources of information, the OSCE voter lists, population estimates from UNHCR and municipality registration data. Additionally, the sampling frame was adjusted in RS using the results of a 1997 census of refugees and displaced people. The entire geographical area of the survey was then divided into segments using probability proportional to size at the municipality level. Each segment covered approximately 110 households. The segments were then randomly selected and an additional number of alternate segments were identified so that in the case of a segment being unusable (empty, mined etc.) an alternate segment could be assigned. 

Stage 2

The fieldwork teams then went to their allocated segments and made a listing of all households in each segment. From these, the fieldwork supervisors with assistance from the entity statistical institutes updated the old maps if necessary, and in some cases made new maps. Where segments were empty of households, had fewer than 80 households or were heavily mined, they were excluded and an alternate segment selected from the reserve list. Adjustments to the sampling plan are described in detail in Appendix C of the final report.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The three questionnaires (household, women aged 15 - 49 and children under the age of five) for the B&H MICS 2000 were based on the MICS Model questionnaires with minor modifications and additions. A household questionnaire was administered in each household, which collected information on household members including sex, age, literacy, marital status and orphanhood status. The household questionnaire also included education, child labour and water and sanitation modules. The questionnaire for women contained the following modules:
·  Child mortality
·  Maternal and new-born health
·  Contraceptive use
·  HIV/AIDS.

The questionnaire for children under the age of five was administered to the mother or carer of the child and included modules on:
·  Birth registration and early learning
·  Care during illness
·  Immunisation
·  Anthropometry

The MICS Model Questionnaires were translated from English into Bosnian/Croatian (Roman script) and Serbian (Cyrillic script). The questionnaires were then pre-tested in 100 households in each entity during June 2000. Based on the results of these pre-tests, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. For the full questionnaires, see Appendix D of the report which is provided as External Resources.","In the Federation 10 teams collected the data, each comprising four interviewers, one driver and a supervisor. In RS, there were 10 teams, each comprising four or five interviewers, a driver and a supervisor. In each entity, a fieldwork co-ordinator provided overall supervision. The field interviewers in each entity were trained for five days and the field supervisors received additional training. The fieldwork began in July 2000 and concluded in September 2000. The survey took place during the school holidays and during a period of very high day time temperatures (up to forty degrees centigrade). Fieldwork quality was maintained as follows: 10 percent of households were re-interviewed by field supervisors; UNICEF conducted field checks on a number of households; and questionnaires were checked by the fieldwork co-ordinator to ensure completeness of data and those with missing or absent data returned for checking. Workshops were organised in each entity using locally modified and translated UNICEF training materials to train data entry staff. Data were entered on seven microcomputers in the Federation and four in Republika Srpska using the ISSA programme (Integrated System for Survey Analysis) and data was analysed using SPSS. In the Federation, seven data entry staff were employed and in the RS four. All questionnaires were doubleentered and internal consistency checks were performed. Data processing began in August 2000 and finished in October 2000. The procedures and standard programmes developed by UNICEF and adapted to the Bosnia and Herzegovina questionnaires were used throughout. The survey was managed using staged contracts, with payment from UNICEF based on meeting agreed quality indicators for all outputs (design, training, fieldwork, data entry, reports, data sets,

Indicators

The list of global indicators being used to assess progress at end-decade was developed through extensive consultation, both within UNICEF, particularly with Programme Division and the Regional Offices, and with WHO, UNESCO and the ILO. The global indicator list can be found in Annex 1 of the Executive Directive EXD/1999-03 dated 23 April 1999.
 
Mid decade experience

There are numerous sources of data for measuring progress at country level, but many either do not function well enough to give current and quality data, or do not provide the data required for assessing progress. Household surveys are capable of filling many of these data gaps. The mid-decade assessment led to 100 countries collecting data using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), household surveys developed to obtain specific mid-decade data, or via MICS questionnaire modules carried by other surveys. By 1996, 60 developing countries had carried out stand-alone MICS, and another 40 had incorporated some of the MICS modules into other surveys. The mid-decade questionnaire and manual, the countries where a standalone MICS was implemented.
 
The end-decade assessment

The end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual have been developed specifically to obtain the data for 63 of the 75 end-decade indicators. These draw heavily on experiences with the mid-decade MICS and the subsequent MICS evaluation. The content is organized into question modules, for countries to adopt or omit according to the data already available. The development of the end-decade MICS questionnaire and manual has drawn on an even wider spread of organizations than the mid-decade MICS. They include WHO, UNESCO, ILO, UNAIDS, the United Nations Statistical Division, CDC Atlanta, MEASURE (USAID), Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and others.","Data downloaded from MICS2 website (www.childinfo.org) on May 24, 2011",,"The 2000 Sierra Leone Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey—2 (MICS2) is a nationally representative survey of households, women, and children.

The sample was selected in three stages using a stratified cluster sampling methodology. Sierra Leone has been demarcated into 2,546 enumeration areas (EAs) for the purpose of collecting census data. The current population of each EA in Sierra Leone was estimated through the use of key informants at the chiefdom level. Refugee camps containing Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were considered to be additional EAs and were included in the sample frame of EAs in order to ensure that IDPs were adequately represented in the survey. Based on the EA population estimates, randomized systematic sampling was used to select 225 EAs for the survey. The probability of an EA’s selection was proportional to the size of its population4, resulting in a self-weighting sample. Selected EAs were divided into segments of approximately 100 households each with the aid of a local informant. Maps of the selected EAs, maintained in the Cartographic Section of the CSO, were used to guide this “segmentation”. One segment in each EA was then randomly selected. The map of this segment was then updated. This segment was then divided into pieces of approximately 20 households, one of which was randomly selected for inclusion in the survey. All households in the selected piece were listed on the Household Listing Form for the EA and included in the survey. This approach to sampling yielded an overall sample size of 4,566 households. A household was defined as “a group of people who all eat from the same pot”, in line with the definition of household used in previous surveys in Sierra Leone. Five of the selected enume ration areas were not surveyed because they were not accessible during the enumeration period. Data from twelve additional EAs in the North that were surveyed were not processed because the fieldworkers had to flee Makeni when hostilities resumed between RUF and government forces in May 2000. Sample weights were used for reporting results to compensate for the seventeen clusters that were not included in the final database. Full technical details of the sampling plan are detailed in Appendix C.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The MICS2 manual provides a carefully constructed core questionnaire that is extremely comprehensive in nature. The core questionnaire is made up of three questionnaires: Household questionnaire, Questionnaire for women, and Questionnaire for children. Explicit instructions are given regarding the addition and subtraction of questions to the core questionnaire. Very minimal modifications were made to the questionnaires for the purpose of the Sierra Leone MICS2. Optional modules such as the Disability Module and the Maternal Mortality Module were modified and added to the core questionnaire. Several additional questions were incorporated into existing modules to provide information pertinent to development and relief efforts in Sierra Leone. Any additions to or deletions from the core questionnaire were done within the guidelines detailed in the MICS2 manual. The household questionnaire was administered in each household. This questionnaire collects information on household members including sex, age, literacy, marital status, and  orphanhood status. The household questionnaire also includes modules on education, child labor, water and sanitation, salt iodization, disability and maternal mortality. The Questionnaire for women and Questionnaire for children were administered in each surveyed household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. For children, the questionnaire was administered to the mother or caretaker of the child.","Data collection commenced immediately following the training of enumerators in late March 2000. The first two days of data collection took place in the Western region under the strict supervision of the Survey Coordinator, the UNICEF M&E Officer and the MICS2 Survey Consultant.

Common mistakes in both enumeration and supervision were observed and immediate feedback was given to the enumerators and supervisors. Based on this experience a Supervision Plan and Supervision Checklist were developed. The Survey Coordinator and the UNICEF M&E Officer used these supervisory tools to guide their subsequent supervision in other regions. Enumerators worked together in EAs in teams of four, and were accompanied by Technical and Associate Supervisors throughout the survey. Enumerators worked individually within households.

The consequences of the conflict on the living standards of the population were severe, with the collapse of the industrial sector, the paralysis of agriculture, and extensive damage to private housing, education and health facilities and other infrastructure. In addition, the conflict brought massive population displacement both within Kosovo and abroad.

A year later, Kosovo was in a process of transition from emergency relief to long-term economic development. The purpose of the survey was to provide crucial information for policy and program design for use by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), international donors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the Kosovar community at large for poverty alleviation and inequality reduction.

During the same period, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was planning an agriculture and livestock survey. It was decided to join both surveys, in order to pool resources and provide better assistance to the newly re-formed Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK) and to take into account the extensive Kosovar peasant household economy. Therefore the agriculture and food aid modules are more developed than those of a standard LSMS survey.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) also was interested in information related to labor force and employment. They had run a socio-demographic and reproductive health survey with the United Nations Population Fund, covering approximately 10,000 households at the end of 1999.

The sample design used in the Kosovo LSMS 2000 had to contend with the fact that the last census, conducted in 1991, was rendered obsolete by the boycott of the Albanian population and by the massive displacements since March 1998.
A Housing Damage Assessment Survey (HDAS) was conducted in February 1999 and updated in June 1999 by the International Management Group (IMG) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the rural areas. The survey covered 95 percent of the Albanian rural areas and provided the basis for the rural sampling frame, after updating. The updating and household listings in selected villages were conducted by FAO.

Since the HDAS did not cover Serbian villages, a quick counting4 of housing units was performed in these villages, following a procedure similar to the one in the urban areas. In urban areas, the original plan was to use the information from the on-going individual
voters’ registration conducted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Since the registration was limited to individuals above 16 years old, it was then decided to conduct a quick counting of households in the 22 urban areas. The quick counting and subsequent listing of households was performed by IOM, under the supervision of the sampling expert hired by the World Bank. 
.
FRAMEWORK

UNMIK divided Kosovo into 5 areas of responsibility (AR), roughly equivalent to the former regions (American – Southeast, British – East including Pristina, French – North, German-South, Italian – West). The rural frame used the IMG/UNHCR Housing Damage Assessment Survey. It was updated with the collaboration of FAO and provided much better information on which to build the sample for the survey. Aerial pictures of the villages selected in the survey were used to help identifying housing units. Only one household was interviewed in each housing unit. For the Serbian villages, counting households and making listings had to be elaborated by the survey team.

In urban areas, IOM contracted the quick counting to SOK in the Albanian cities and to firms in the Serb areas. These firms updated existing lists, or performed some quick counting. Using the updated information IOM created enumeration areas of size 150-200 housing units. Based on this quick counting, a full listing took place in all the selected EAs and 12 households were randomly selected. Given safety issues and quality problems discovered at the enumeration stage, the Serb urban listings were revised after the end of the survey, by the Serb survey team, who had performed the rural listings.

The sample was preset at 2,880 households in order to allow analyses in the following breakdowns: (a) Kosovo as a whole; (b) by area of responsibility, (c) by urban/rural locations. In addition, the survey data can be used to derive separate estimates for the Serbian minority.

In the rural area, 30 Albanian villages were randomly selected in each AR and a listing of all households in the village was established.5 In each village, 12 households were then randomly selected (8 for interviewing and 4 reserve households). Similarly, 30 urban enumeration areas (between 150 and 200 households lie in each urban EA) were randomly selected in the Albanian part of each AR. Twelve households were then selected in each EA. In the rural area, 30 Serb villages were selected from the three municipalities in the northern part of Kosovo, the enclaves and the municipality of Strepce. Thirty urban EA were selected in the same region. In each village and urban area, 12 households were then randomly selected.

STRATIFICATION

In addition to the explicit stratification of the areas of responsibility and the ethnic composition in each rural and urban category, an implicit stratification of geographic ordering in a serpentine method in the villages and urban enumeration areas was followed. In order to be able to provide estimates for the separate domains described above, it was recommended that 240 households be interviewed in each domain. We had very little prior knowledge of response rates. In the rural villages, it was decided to select 12 households and identify 4 of them as “reserve households”. These reserve households were to be used only in specific cases, described at length to the logistics person/driver of the interviewing team. The final sample size was 1,200 rural and urban Albanian households and 240 rural and urban Serb households, for a total sample size of 2,880 households.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Two questionnaires were used to collect the information: a household questionnaire and a community questionnaire. No anthropometric information was collected as malnutrition problems, facing Kosovar children and women, would not be detected by these procedures.

Since FAO and SOK were conducting a price survey in 7 cities of Kosovo, on a monthly basis, it was decided to not include a separate price questionnaire but use the data from the FAO-SOK price survey. The Kosovo LSMS 2000 collected information using a household questionnaire, which was based in part on the standard LSMS questionnaire developed in Grosh and Glewwe (2000).

The standard questionnaire was adapted to the specifics of the Kosovar environment and special modules about displacement, food aid and social protection were added. Individual modules were administered as much as possible to most informed respondents. Box 1 contains a summary of the content of the questionnaire.

The community questionnaire was designed to collect information on community-level infrastructure, with a special emphasis on school and health facilities as well as displaced persons issues. Box 2 contains a summary of the content of the community questionnaire. [Note: Community is defined as the Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) of the survey. In rural areas, it generally encompasses villages unless these are less than 50 households (in which case, they were grouped with a neighboring village) or more than 200 households (in which case, they were broken-up in PSUs of 50-200 households). In urban areas, community is defined as the Enumeration Area but includes the larger city when referring to secondary school and university, hospitals and factories.]","PILOT TEST

The pilot test of the household survey was performed in rural areas around Pristina (Albanian British rural) and in an apartment complex of Pristina (Albanian British urban) in the last week of August 2000. For the pilot, all questionnaires had random starting modules so as to ensure that all modules were tested during the limited time available for this exercise. The total number of interviews was approximately 50 completed interviews. Given the severe logistic constraints (see section VIII), it was not possible to perform a pilot test in the Serbian areas. Required changes to adapt the questionnaire to Serb specificity were done during the field practices of the Serbian field team training. The Albanian pilot was administered by 12 members of the SOK team, with previous experience in interviewing. The experience of the pilot led us to changes in the questionnaires and was crucial in assessing the time needed for the interviews as well as the relative difficulty of specific modules.

ORGANIZATION AND FIELDWORK PROCEDURES

The household questionnaire was administered by teams consisting of one supervisor, five interviewers, and a driver/logistic agent in the Albanian areas. Of the five interviewers, one was specialized in the agriculture and consumption modules, or used as a additional interviewer when the household size was too large to enable one interviewer to complete an interview in a reasonable amount of time. There were a total of 8 teams for the Albanian interviews.

The supervisors were responsible for making sure that the interviewers had all the materials they needed and for solving all minor problems that came up in the field. In addition, the supervisor was in charge of administering the community questionnaire in each village/urban EA. The driver/logistics person was in charge of explaining the survey to the households selected to participate and setting up interviews6 with the respondent households. They were also responsible for selecting the reserve households in the cases specifically assigned by the field manager.

In the Serbian areas, a total of fourteen interviewers were recruited and trained, with six from the northern part of Kosovo and eight from the enclaves. One Kosovar Serb coordinator was in charge of the field operations. A Macedonian Albanian driver and a British field assistant were contracted to ensure the safe transportation of one of the Southern interviewing teams between Serbian settlements, and to address potential safety issues. The other team used local transportation to the villages which could be safely reached from Gracenica. One international French staff member supervised the teams in the South and another French staff member supervised the team in the North, going to Mitrovica on a daily basis.

The household questionnaire for the Kosovo LSMS was generally administered in one visit to the household. On average, it took two to three hours to administer the questionnaire in Albanian rural areas, an hour and a half to two hours in the Albanian urban areas. For the Serbian areas, the respective times were one hour and a half in the rural areas and one hour in urban areas. The difference in timing seems to be mainly due to the much larger household size and variety of income activities among the Kosovar Albanians. The training for the administration of the questionnaire for the Albanian team was held between September 6 and 23, 2000 in SOK in Pristina, with field practices September 18-23. The training was conducted by an Albanian demographer, assisted by a UNDP staff member seconded to the survey and a FAO staff member in charge of the agricultural module. The survey itself was administered from September 25 through November 4, 2000 in the rural areas and from November 10 through December 4, 2000 in the urban areas.

The training for the Serbian team was held between October 8 and 24, in Gracenica, with field practices on October 23 and 24. The training was conducted by an international consultant and the Serbian Kosovar supervisor. The survey itself was administered from October 25 to November 22, 2000 in the rural areas and through December 18 in the urban areas. The first questionnaires were administered by teams in Prizren and Peja.

COMMUNITY SURVEY

The rural community questionnaire was administered by the team supervisor during the time that the team was in the village doing the household enumeration. The supervisor contacted the mayor of the village, or failing that, a local leader such as the school principal. If there is more than one name on the list of respondents in the community questionnaire, the respondents were interviewed together.

The rural community questionnaire was fairly straight forward to administer because the boundaries of the village are clear in everyone's mind and there was no ambiguity about: (a) a facility existing or not in the community; or (b) the distance to the facility. In the Serbian areas in the south, the community questionnaires were mainly administered by the Serb team coordinator, with several done by the team supervisors. There were political tensions in the enclaves, and they had to be mindful of this when trying to find someone in authority to interview since there were no clear cut leaders. Several times they were unable to identify someone on the days they were in the village for enumeration and had to return to the village in the following days. The Serb villages in the north were much like the Albanian villages, with an identifiable leader available. The supervisor of the northern team did all the community
questionnaire interviews. 

The urban community questionnaire was more difficult to administer. There was no time during the urban enumeration for the supervisors to find the proper respondents, and it was difficult to determine the best way to obtain the data. The education facilities, health facilities and industry portions of the questionnaire were done on a city-wide basis with subject matter specialists for each module. For example, in Gjacova the supervisor went to the Department of Education for the school location and enrollment information, to the Department of Health for the hospital information, and to the government official who had information on the industries in the city for that portion of the questionnaire. This means that each community questionnaire for Gjacova will have the same information for these three modules. The rest of the modules were administered to a leader, or group of leaders, in the enumeration area.

The data from community questionnaire are not a representative sample of communities in Kosovo. These data are intended to provide information on the context in which the households are located for the analyses of the household data.

POST-CONFLICT ISSUES

The survey took place during a period of political transition in the former Yugoslavia region, with tensions in Montenegro in August-September, ousting of President Milosevic in Serbia on October 5, and municipal elections in Kosovo on October 28. The political context influenced the logistics of interviews in the Serbian areas and the post-conflict patterns of behavior of respondent households.

Access to ethnic minorities

Enumeration of the Serbs as a separate frame required counting households in all Serbian villages and urban zones. The rural Serb population in Kosovo numbers about 80,000, of which 20,000 live in the Northern part of Kosovo (3 municipalities) and the rest is scattered in the “enclaves” of Southern and Central Kosovo and in the southern municipality of Strepce (Evans, 2000). Of the 30 selected villages, 8 are in Northern Kosovo. Twenty-four of the urban EAs are also located there, because of the larger urban areas of Mitrovica and Zvecan. Access to communities for counting and listing required securing the agreement of local political leaders, in the enclaves as well as in the North. Training had to be organized separately for the field teams as their safety would have been put into question in SOK facilities. Recruiting of Serb field staff was relatively more difficult in the enclaves, due to the aging of the population, which chose to remain there (Salama et al. 2000). The trainees from the North were all university students.

Training took place in Gracenica, which required the interviewers from the North to travel daily, from Mitrovica North to Pristina on UN transportation, with no guarantees that their safety could be ensured in the event of a mechanical problem of the UN bus. Transportation between Pristina and Gracenica, and also between enclaves for the field work, in a project jeep required contracting a Macedonian driver and a British field assistant to be at all times with the driver. The driver, the Serb team and the field assistant were in radio contact at all times. 

Security for the field workers was a primary concern during the field work. Because some of the quick counting and household listings were contracted out, safety related information was not always relayed to the team planning the logistics of the field work. Some supposedly Serb houses in southern enclaves were in fact occupied by Albanian households which were not pleased when the Serb interviewers appeared. This required double-checking before fieldwork could proceed. Some zones in North Mirovica were deemed too dangerous to be listed systematically and the names were taken from a dweller. This information was not relayed to the interviewing team, when the EA was selected into the sample. As a result, the team was pulled out of the field and alternative EAs had to be selected. These examples show the importance of good communication between the different components of the survey team.",,,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The non-response rate among households originally selected for inclusion in the sample in rural Albanian areas was 11.8 percent and 20.8 percent in urban Albanian areas. These rates in the Serbian areas were 14.2 percent among rural households and 39.2 percent among urban households. 

In the rural Albanian areas, non-response came mostly from households having moved outside of the village. A few refusals were due to the fact that households were in mourning or celebrating other religious occasions (wedding, baptisms, circumcisions, etc…), or the household head was a women alone. There were only 20 actual refusals of the originally selected households, only 2 percent of the 1,200 households originally contacted.

In the Serbian rural areas, half of the non-responses were due to households having traveled to Serbia for visits (holidays, health care issues, indefinite travel….). Other reasons included: interviewer’s safety (houses too isolated) and households refusing to respond in the absence of the head. There were only 5 such cases, again only 2 percent of the 240 households originally contacted. In the urban areas, 10 percent of the non-responses were linked to listings problems (non-existent addresses). Another 75 percent came from households having moved (temporarily or indefinitely) and/or renting their dwelling to KFOR and international staff. The remaining reasons included refusals for security and illness reasons. There were only 6 such cases, again close to 2 percent of the 240 households originally contacted.","On receiving these data it is recognized that the data are supplied for use within your  organization, and you agree to the following stipulations as conditions for the use of the data:

If corrections were necessary, the questionnaires were returned to the enumerators, for revisions and/or return to the household.

The data entry program was designed using CSPro, a data entry package developed by the US Census Bureau. This software allows programs to be developed to perform three types of data checks: (a) range checks, (b) intra-record checks to verify inconsistencies inside a module, and (c) inter-records checks to determine inconsistencies between different modules of the questionnaire. The data entry program was designed by a consultant and field checked and translated into Albanian, with the help of the local data entry supervisor. 

The data were key entered at SOK headquarters, in a semi-concurrent fashion, by eight data entry operators. In addition, nine SOK staff performed a double-data entry of a part of the data. This was designed as an additional quality check as well as on-the-job training for the SOK data entry operators.

Data entry for the household survey was completed by December 31, 2000. A 3-day delay was caught-up with during the week break, preceding the October 28 elections. Data from the Serbian questionnaires were also key entered at SOK headquarters since all but one data entry staff could read Serbian and the format of the questionnaire stayed identical. At the end of the data entry, some errors were found in the CS-Pro program and some sections were reentered.

The TLSS sample was designed to represent the population of the country as a whole as well as the strata. The sample was stratified by oblast and by urban and rural areas.

The country is divided into 4 oblasts, or regions; Leninabad in the northwest of the country, Khatlon in the southwest, Rayons of Republican Subordination (RRS) in the middle and to the west of the country, and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) in the east. The capital, Dushanbe, in the RRS oblast, is a separately administrated area. Oblasts are divided into rayons (districts). Rayons are further subdivided into Mahallas (committees) in urban areas, and Jamoats (villages) in rural areas.","- Households

The sample was stratified by oblast and by urban and rural areas.

In common with standard LSMS practice a two-stage sample was used. In the first stage 125 primary sample units (PSU) were selected with the probability of selection within strata being proportional to size. At the second stage, 16 households were selected within each PSU, with each household in the area having the same probability of being chosen. [Note: In addition to the main sample, the TLSS also included a secondary sample of 15 extra PSU (containing 400 households) in Dangara and Varzob. Data in the oversampled areas were collected for the sole purpose of providing baseline data for the World Bank Health Project in these areas. The sampling for these additional units was carried out separately after the main sampling procedure in order to allow for their exclusion in nationally representative analysis.]  The twostage procedure has the advantage that it provides a self-weighted sample. It also simplified the fieldwork operation as a one-field team could be assigned to cover a number of PSU.

A critical problem in the sample selection with Tajikistan was the absence of an up to date national sample frame from which to select the PSU. As a result lists of the towns, rayons and jamoats (villages) within rayons were prepared manually. Current data on population size according to village and town registers was then supplied to the regional offices of Goskomstat and conveyed to the center. This allowed the construction of a sample frame of enumeration units by sample size from which to draw the PSU.

This procedure worked well in establishing a sample frame for the rural population. However administrative units in some of the larger towns and in the cities of Dushanbe, Khojand and Kurgan-Tubbe were too large and had to be sub-divided into smaller enumeration units. Fortuitously the survey team was able to make use of information available as a result of the mapping exercise carried out earlier in the year as preparation for the 2000 Census in order to subdivide these larger areas into enumeration units of roughly similar size.

The survey team was also able to use the household listings prepared for the Census for the second stage of the sampling in urban areas. In rural areas the selection of households was made using the village registers – a complete listing of all households in the village which is (purported to be) regularly updated by the local administration. When selecting the target households a few extra households (4 in addition to the 16) were also randomly selected and were to be used if replacements were needed. In actuality non-response and refusals from households were very rare and use of replacement households was low. There was never the case that the refusal rate was so high that there were not enough households on the reserve list and this enabled a full sample of 2000 randomly selected households to be interviewed.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaire was based on the standard LSMS for the CIS countries, and adapted and abridged for Tajikistan. In particular the health section was extended to allow for more in depth information to be collected and a section on food security was also added. The employment section was reduced and excludes information on searching for employment. 

The questionnaires were translated into Tajik, Russian and Uzbek.

The TLSS consists of three parts: a household questionnaire, a community level questionnaire and a price questionnaire.

Household questionnaire: the Household questionnaire is comprised of 10 sections covering both household and individual aspects.

Community/Population point Questionnaire: the Community level or Population Point Questionnaire consists of 8 sections. The community level questionnaire provides information on differences in demographic and economic infrastructure. Open-ended questions in the questionnaire were not coded and hence information on the responses to these qualitative questions is not provided in the data sets.

Summary of Section contents

The brief descriptions below provide a summary of the information found in each section. The descriptions are by no means exhaustive of the information covered by the survey and users of the survey need to refer to each particular section of the questionnaire for a complete picture of the information gathered.

Household information/roster
This includes individual level information of all individuals in the household. It establishes who belongs to the household at the time of the interview. Information on gender, age, relation to household head and marital status are included. In the question relating to family status, question 7, “Nekared” means married where nekar is the Islamic (arabic) term for marriage contract. Under Islamic law a man may marry more than once (up-to four wives at any one time). Although during the Soviet period it was illegal to be married to more than one woman this practice did go on. There may be households where the household head is not present but the wife is married or nekared, or in the same household a respondent may answer married and another nekared to the household head.

Dwelling
This section includes information covering the type of dwelling, availability of utilities and water supply as well as questions pertaining to dwelling expenses, rents, and the payment of utilities and other household expenses. Information is at the household level.

Education
This section includes all individuals aged 7 years and older and looks at educational attainment of individuals and reasons for not continuing education for those who are not currently studying. Questions related to educational expenditures at the household level are also covered. Schooling in Tajikistan is compulsory for grades (classes) 1-9. Primary level education refers to grades 1 - 4 for children aged 7 to 11 years old. General secondary level education refers to grades 5-9, corresponding to the age group 12-16 year olds. Post-compulsory schooling can be divided into three types of school:
- Upper secondary education covers the grades 10 and 11.
- Vocational and Technical schools can start after grade 9 and last around 4 years. These schools can also start after grade 11 and then last only two years. Technical institutions provide medical and technical (e.g. engineering) education as well as in the field of the arts while vocational schools
provide training for employment in specialized occupation.
- Tertiary or University education can be entered after completing all 11 grades.
- Kindergarten schools offer pre-compulsory education for children aged 3 – 6 years old and information on this type of schooling is not covered in this section.

Health
This section examines individual health status and the nature of any illness over the recent months. Additional questions relate to more detailed information on the use of health care services and hospitals, including expenses incurred due to ill health. Section 4B includes a few terms, abbreviations and acronyms that need further clarification. A feldscher is an assistant to a physician. Mediniski dom or FAPs are clinics staffed by physical assistants and/or midwifes and a SUB is a local clinic. CRH is a local hospital while an oblast hospital is a regional hospital based in the oblast administrative centre, and the Repub. Hospital is a national hospital based in the capital, Dushanbe. The latter two are both public hospitals.

Employment
This section covers individuals aged 11 years and over. The first part of this section looks at the different activities in which individuals are involved in order to determine if a person is engaged in an income generating activity. Those who are engaged in such activities are required to answer questions in Part B. This part relates to the nature of the work and the organization the individual is attached to as well as questions relating to income, cash income and in-kind payments. There are also a few questions relating to additional income generating activities in addition to the main activity. Part C examines employment history in the previous two years.

Migration
This section covers all individuals aged 15 years and older and determines how long respondents have resided in their present location. Part B relates to households who were displaced, detailing how many in the family were affected and for what reason. Part C relates to the property left by those who are displaced.

Sources of Income of the Household
This section covers specified sources of income over the previous month from all members in the household. Part A includes wage income, movable property and alimony, while part B includes information on income from social protection payments, such as employment pensions and family allowances. Part B also includes a summary question on total income from all sources for all household members.

Consumption and Expenditures
This section gathers information on household expenditure and in particular consumption. Part A focuses on a summary of 24 categories of household expenditures undertaken over the last month and the last year. Part B covers information on 33 specified food items, including expenditure on the item as well as the value of growing and consuming the goods. Part C provides information on issues of food security and coping strategies and includes questions on subjective perceptions of welfare.

List of Durables
This section includes ownership of 16 durable items, including motorcycles and cars.

Agriculture
This section provides information across a variety of agricultural aspects. Part A focuses on land use and ownership across different specified land types, including how much was earned across land types. Part B includes questions on costs of inputs and outputs of land and livestock. Part C covers income and expenditure across 17 specified agricultural related property including different livestock and different equipment.

Female Questionnaire
This section of the questionnaire looks at particular aspects of the health of married women, in particular fertility issues. Another part of this section focuses on information on each child born to the respondent.

Population Point /Community
This section provides information on the nature of the different population points. Part 1 covers demographic information such as population of the community and the ethnic make-up. The part focusing on infrastructure includes questions on the availability of different utilities, distance from the capital and the quality of the roads. A part on the nature of the economy of the population point includes information on the economic activity in the area, the existence of state enterprises and to what extent economic conditions have changed over the last year. Another part focuses on information on refugees or displaced persons in the population point. There is a section on education relating to the school attendance of boy and girls and to the quality of the schools in the area. Information on the availability of health facilities and medication, as well as the quality of these services is also included. A section on agriculture focuses on the nature of the agricultural activities in the community, including questions on irrigation and the use of specific inputs. There is also a question on the average wage of specified agricultural labour. The final part provides information on the availability and accessibility of 45 different institutions and services, for example, dentists, kindergartens, state employment services, theatres and bus stations.","Fieldwork teams

A total of 60 fieldwork staff were recruited and divided into 12 fieldwork teams of 1 supervisor plus 4 interviewers. Out of the 12 Supervisors, 8 were employees of the State Statistical Agency and 4 were from the Center for Strategic Research. Of the 48 interviewers, 36 were employees of
the State Statistical Agency and the remaining 12 were from other government and public organizations. 

Training

Supervisors were trained over a period of 5 days in March 1999 which included two days of training, two days of field work which was used to pilot the survey and one day summary discussion. The Supervisors then also participated in the training for the interviewers, which was also held over 5 days prior to the start of the main fieldwork operation. The main survey began on 3rd May 1999.

Pilot Survey

The household questionnaire was piloted over 2 days in 3 Jamoats. A total of 40 households were surveyed over 2 days. Pilot projects were selected in Dushanbe in October and Frunze rayons (two Mahalla Committees), Gissar rayon (two jamoats) and Varzob rayon (three jamoats). Each interviewer surveyed 4 households over 2 days, with a total of 192 households covered in 2 days. Supervisors were responsible for overseeing the sampling methodology of households and ensuring the questionnaires were completed correctly.

Difficulties encountered

A few selected jamoats that were initially selected had to be replaced since permission to sample in those areas was not granted. Permission was obtained from the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) which control parts of the Karategin Valley.

In rural areas, it took longer to complete the interviews because more time was needed to respond to the questions on agriculture, definitions of income and covering the greater number of children in the household. In cities, (particularly Dushanbe) there were a few problems with respondents not willing to participate.

In only a few cases were the female questionnaires completed in the presence of the respondent's husband. In a few regions, the interviewers encountered additional problems including the exposure to the risk of typhoid and scabies, and had to take precautions when carrying out the interviews.",,,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged by including a citation which would include:

A Multipurpose Poverty Survey (KMPS) was conducted in October and November 1993 with a sample of about 2,000 households and 10,000 members of those households. The 1993 KMPS survey was designed to be a nationally representative survey of living standards in the Kyrgyz Republic during the second half of 1993. After the 1993 KMPS, a Social Safety Net (SSN) project was launched in the Kyrgyz Republic. This SSN project had a Poverty Monitoring Component (PMC) which includes conducting an annual Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Survey (KPMS) for four years, 1996-1999. The task of conducting these surveys and overall coordination of project activities was given to the National Statistical Committee (NATSTATCOM) of the Kyrgyz Republic with technical assistance from Research Triangle Institute (RTI) based in the United States. 

The first KPMS data collection was completed during the months of February and March (Spring) 1996 using the same survey questionnaires as the 1993 survey. After that NATSTATCOM decided that survey data would be collected during the Fall season and as a result the remaining KPMS were carried out during the months of October and November (Fall) of 1996, 1997 and 1998. 

The questionnaires used in KPMS were more or less similar. The Fall 1996 (second) KPMS added an Employment Module on the household questionnaire used earlier (Spring 1996). The 1997 (third) KPMS added questions on Family Planning to the Female Health Module. The 1998 (Fourth) KPMS used a similar questionnaire to that of the 1997, but with an extended agricultural module.",,,"The main purpose of the KPMS surveys is to provide data for the study of multiple aspects of household welfare and behavior, analysis of poverty, and understanding the effect of government policies on households.",National coverage,"- Households

However, the Fall 1996-1998 KPMS surveys used a new sampling frame based on the Kyrgyz Household Registration System. This system was taken from the Census Posts intended for use by the first National Census of the Kyrgyz Republic. Using this system, NATSTATCOM updated the central household registration files effective January 1, 1996, and the information that was used for the sampling frame was as up to date as possible. The procedures followed in the stratification and identification of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were similar for all rounds of the KPMS as discussed below. 

Formation of Strata 

Initially the country was divided into seven (7) strata defined by oblasts (Oblasts are administrative divisions of the country which in turn are sub-divided in to Rayons) and by residence location (i.e. urban vs. rural) within oblasts. The rural portion of Bishkek oblast was combined with the rural portion of neighboring Chui oblast for stratification purposes as Bishkek has practically no rural population. 

Selection of PSUs and Households 

For the 1998 KPMS, a total of 255 PSUs (of which 178 were urban and 77 rural) were identified. The estimated total population was around 1.1 million of which about 421,000 was classified as urban. A minimum of 384 households per oblast was targeted in order to get a representative data at the oblast level11. This translated in to a targeted sample size of 2,688 households for the whole of the Kyrgyz Republic (i.e. 384*7 oblasts=2,688). These households were divided into urban (887 households) and rural (1,801 households). The overall projected response rate for the 1998 KPMS was also set at somewhat above 0.90. With an overall sampling rate of 1/336, this resulted in to a sample close to a target size of 3,000 households for the whole survey. 

Once the strata and PSUs were formed and identified, selection of sample PSUs and households was then carried out in the following order: 

1) Selection of large and small towns12 
[Note: For the 1998 KPMS, large towns were defined as those with a population size of 41,125 or larger. Small towns are those with population less than 41,125. This number, according to a NATSTATCOM document was calculated as follows: n=4.7*350*25. This calculation was based on an estimated household size of 4.7, an estimated interval rate of 350 and an average work load per interviewer of 25 households. No further information is available regarding the bases of such an assumption. At the moment, we do not have information about the cut off number that separates large towns from small ones for the other two KPMS.] 

2) Selection of Census Posts in urban areas 

3) Selection of Ayil Kenshes (village authorities) and population points in rural areas, and 

4) Selection of households from selected Census Posts and Ayil Kenshes. 
In the rural stratum of each oblast, villages were used as the listing units and within these listing units, equal probability sampling methods were used to select the ultimate sampling units (households). 
In urban areas, the centralized computer listings from various sources of household registration were used for the selection of households. These lists are categorized into four: 
Type 1 - Private house resident households listed by BTIs 
Type 2 - Public house residents listed with other organizations with dormitories only 
Type 3 - Public and private households listed by JSKs 
Type 4 - Public and private households listed by all other organizations. 
In some cases, private households were included in the last three public categories (Types 2, 3 and 4). However, only public households were selected from these types since it was believed that any private households listed in these category types were also included in the Type 1 category. The counts for Type 2, 3, and 4 lists were then adjusted based on the oblast estimates of all urban households.13 Prior to actual household sample selection, lists from types 2 to 4 were updated and adjusted to remove private households, so that any potential double eligibility was eliminated. Urban strata were then formed within each oblast based on type of household listing. In most cases, types had to be combined to form strata of a reasonable size. 

Within the limits of rounding and requiring at least one sampling unit per stratum, the allocation of sampling units to urban strata was proportional to the number of households projected for that stratum after allowing for removal of duplicates (private households appearing on a BTI and other lists). 

As for rural households, selection of urban households was done using systematic random sampling within each stratum except that more subdividing of urban lists was required before selecting the final list sample that defines each sampling unit. 

Even though the list sources were identified and sampled using data as of January 1, 1996 (and using projections of unduplicated counts in some cases), the final listings were updated in the field just prior to the survey period. Therefore, the sample households in selected areas were drawn from the most current available listings.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The KPMS surveys were carried out using a household questionnaire and a community (population point) questionnaire. The household questionnaires were used to collect demographic information on the composition of the household, housing, household consumption including home production, as well as economic activities in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. For each household member, individual level data on health, education, migration and labor was collected using the household questionnaires. Community questionnaires were used to collect price data and the presence of social services and infrastructure in the community (population point) where the sampled household is located. 

The household questionnaire was extensive and required several hours of intense interviewing to gather all that was needed from each household and its embers. The household questionnaire was split into two parts. The first part was used to collect data through a face to face interview on household roster, dwelling, education, health, migration, etc. At the end of the first part, members who shop for food for the whole household and those who know most about income, expenditure and savings of other household members were identified and designated as respondents for the next part (second round). The second round of interview was administered two weeks after the first half and collected data on crops, food and animal products produced by the household, food expenditure and home produced food consumption. 

Some sections of the household questionnaire such as those that deal with dwelling and expenditure information were administered to the person most knowledgeable of the family's overall expenditures, income and other finances as well as about the family's business activities and employment. In other sections, each adult in each sample household was interviewed individually. The information gathered from each household included extensive data on education, health, employment, migration, reproduction and reproductive health (for women aged 15 to 49), land use, expenditure, revenue and other financial matters, as well as anthropometric measurements (for children 5 years and younger). Information about children under 14 years of age was collected by asking the relevant questions to the adult household member who is primarily responsible for each child's care. 

The community (Population Point) questionnaires were administered to each sample cluster. They were used to collect data on prices of goods and services, distance to schools, shopping and medical facilities, types of housing, commercial and private land use and availability of infrastructure. 

HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE

The KPMS household questionnaires generally contain 15 major sections, and each of these sections covers a separate aspect of household activity. In some cases, the section has sub-sections. These household questionnaires were designed to better assess the changing environment brought about by the advent of a market economy and to enable a more in depth analysis of topics such as housing, health, and education. The various sections of the KPMS household questionnaire are described below.The household questionnaires administered in the KPMS surveys are more or less similar with minor modifications and additions in the successive rounds of the KPMS. 

POPULATION POINT QUESTIONNAIRE
 
The community (population point) questionnaire was used to collect information and data that are relevant to the community/population point where the household is located. The questionnaire was designed to be administered in the geographical area of each sample cluster. It was used to collect data regarding prices of goods and services in the local area and data on community infrastructure. Respondents to these questionnaires are those believed to be well informed members of the community that the interviewers identified by going to the rayon, city, oblast administration or other governmental agency located in the population point6. The questionnaire also contains sections to be administered to retail outlets in the neighborhoods that sell various products such as food, drinks, tobacco products and fuel. Other data collected using the population point questionnaire includes distance to schools, distance to shopping and to medical facilities, commercial and private land use in the community, availability of electricity, water, communication and other infrastructure. Similar population point questionnaires were used in all KPMS. The population point questionnaires were completed by the field supervisors. The population point questionnaire contains nine (9) major sections","SURVEY MANAGEMENT AND PREPARATIONS

Conducting the Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Surveys (KPMS) and the overall coordination of project related activities were mandates of the NATSTATCOM. Research Triangle Institute (RTI) of the United States was contracted to provide technical assistance to NATSTATCOM in relation to most of the KPMS activities. 

Once the final schedule for the KPMS surveys had been established by NATSTATCOM, a number of early survey preparations were done. These included the finalization of the statistical sampling design, the creation of survey training manuals, finalization of survey field forms and instruments, and the planning for and selection of appropriate staff to assist with the surveys, both from within the Central NATSTATCOM and from the oblast (regional) statistical offices. 
Representatives of various ministries who made up the users' group were provided with draft copies of both the Household and Population Point Questionnaires in each round of the KPMS. The group members provided insights to the various modules of the questionnaires based on their sectoral knowledge. 

Training manuals and field forms were created for the proper administration of the KPMS surveys. Final translations of the survey instruments into Russian and Kyrgyz were completed and the instruments printed. Field Supervisor and Field Interviewer Manuals were also prepared. Two copies of the final sample cluster household listings were given to each oblast office so that the oblast coordinators and field supervisors would have their own copies. 
To properly staff the survey field operations within each oblast, the number of clusters expected from each oblast and the number of households expected from each cluster were calculated and this information was also given to the oblast coordinators. With assistance from the survey team, the oblast coordinators identified the proper locations of clusters within their oblasts for field supervisors and field interviewers. Supervisors and interviewers were assigned on a full-time basis for the whole period of data collection. Generally these supervisors and interviewers were NATSTATCOM oblast employees and this was a key to the success of the survey operations. By having supervisors and interviewers who already reported to the oblast coordinator (or NATSTATCOM Chairman) in their regular jobs, the chain of command was already established, well understood and adhered to. 

Other preparations for the survey included the identification and procurement of appropriate anthropometric equipments. These included scales (for weighing sample household family members) and measuring tapes (for measuring the upper arms, waist and hips of the members). Although the anthropometric procedures were simple, care was taken in the preparation of proper instructions that clearly define these procedures. 

A Data Entry Operator's Manual was also prepared. This manual provided full instructions for entering the data, quality control measures to be taken and preparation of the final data files to be taken to the NATSTATCOM central office. 

TRAINING OF SURVEY STAFF

Training was given to field staff at several levels sequentially in the following order: central office staff, oblast coordinators (the NATSTATCOM chairman in each oblast), field supervisors, and field interviewers. The appropriate training materials were also developed. The training schedules for KPMS 1996 and 1998 were as follows: 
1) Central NATSTATCOM staff training (in Bishkek) -- This training took place between October 26 and November 1, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 10 to 15, 1998 for the 1998 KPMS. 
2) Oblast Coordinators and Field Supervisors from all oblasts (in Bishkek) -- This took place between November 4 and 10, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 19 to 24, 1998 for the 1998 KPMS. 
3) Field Interviewers in each oblast (at the oblast offices) -- This took place between November 11 and 18, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 27 to 31, 1998 for KPMS 1998. 

The NATSTATCOM oblast coordinators (chairmen) and the field supervisors attended training both in Bishkek and in their respective oblasts. The initial training in Bishkek focused on proper survey administration, quality control and financial management. 

Care was taken in training to review the procedures for locating and identifying sample households within the sample clusters selected. This training was reinforced by careful review and further explanation of the actual sample listings provided, for each cluster, to both the field supervisors and field interviewers. The importance of correct ID numbering and field quality control procedures by both interviewers and supervisors was stressed throughout the training. 

On the last day of each training session, extensive consultation was done to ensure a clear understanding of the materials, and what is expected from each trainee and the procedures to be followed in conducting the interview. Survey supplies and anthropometric equipment were then distributed. 

After the completion of the training for field supervisors and field interviewers, training was given to data entry staff at the NATSTATCOM central offices followed by training of the data entry staff in each oblast. The software used for the data entry was BLAISE III, a product of the Department of Statistics for the Netherlands.  The data entry personnel at the central office were trained first. This was followed by training at the oblast level via visits to each oblast. Data entry training in oblasts were conducted following a few weeks of survey data collection. Thus these data entry people were able to use actual data from a backlog of completed questionnaires for their hands-on training. 
The key data entry people were first trained about the overall data entry procedures for two days. They then started to enter the actual survey data while, at the same time, their work was closely supervised as a quality control measure for about two more days. Key entry personnel who had problems were retrained and brought up to a proper quality level or replaced.

Upon completion of the data entry at each oblast, diskettes containing all data were sent to the central office (NATSTATCOM) for compilation, final editing and cleaning. All population point questionnaires were keyed by the central office data entry staff.","In analyzing the KPMS datasets, there are two weighting variables that should be used to extrapolate results nationally. These variables are 'Weight' and 'Expansion Factor' and are included in the consumption/expenditure aggregates of the 1997 and 1998 KPMS datasets. The 1996 expenditure aggregate does not have these variables, but average comparative weighting factors can be derived using the inverse of the sampling rate. Weight is a variable derived as a product of household size multiplied by the expansion factor and it is used for household level variables. Expansion factor is a variable that is used for individual level variables.",,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged by including a citation which would include:

Response rates were examined during the 1996 KPMS period to see if differential response rates for different strata might justify unequal weighting to reduce any potential bias during data analysis. the differences in response rates among strata were small, as the rates range from 0.905 to 1.000. The overall response rate was high (0.959) and, as expected, the response rate for rural strata was slightly greater than the one for urban strata. Under these circumstances, weight adjustment for nonresponse appears optional. For most analyses, it was believed that it would have little impact and would unnecessarily complicate the analysis. No such weighting adjustment was therefore done for all the KPMS surveys.","In receiving these data it is recognized that the data are supplied for use within your organization, and you agree to the following stipulations as conditions for the use of the data:

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A housing unit means a building or a part of building which is meant for residence of household.  It is separate from other parts inside the building from construction and residential point of view.  There could be one or more than one housing units/dwelling units in one building, and at the time of enumeration more than one household can reside in one housing unit.
- Households: A household means one or more than one person who lives under one cooking arrangement and other common necessities of life.  If one person is living alone, he will also be treated as one household.  Generally, the members of household are relatives, but the friends, servants of the household and other non relatives residing with them can also be included in the household.
- Group quarters: Housing unit which has been constructed or specified as the collective residence of some social, governmental or business purpose, e.g. hotel, hostel, residential, barracks of armed or semi armed forces, residential camps, jails, sanatorium, mental hospital disabled, poor, orphans paupers and institutions etc specified for residence at other such persons.","All those persons who reside in Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern areas and within the boundaries of tribal areas, including Afghans refugees mixing up and living with general population out of camps.",Census/enumeration data [cen],,"[{'name': 'Pakistan', 'abbreviation': 'PAK'}]",,"[{'topic': 'Technical Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Group Quarters Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Constructed Family Interrelationship Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Demographic Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Education Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: M-Z Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Dwelling Characteristics Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Technical Person Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Nativity and Birthplace Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Geography: Global Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Utilities Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Household Economic Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Other Household Variables -- HOUSEHOLD', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Other Person Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}, {'topic': 'Ethnicity and Language Variables -- PERSON', 'vocab': 'IPUMS', 'uri': ''}]","[{'start': '1998-03-05', 'end': '1998-03-15', 'cycle': ''}]","MICRODATA SOURCE: Population Census Organization

A Multipurpose Poverty Survey (KMPS) was conducted in October and November 1993 with a sample of about 2,000 households and 10,000 members of those households. The 1993 KMPS survey was designed to be a nationally representative survey of living standards in the Kyrgyz Republic during the second half of 1993.

However, the Fall 1996-1998 KPMS surveys used a new sampling frame based on the Kyrgyz Household Registration System. This system was taken from the Census Posts intended for use by the first National Census of the Kyrgyz Republic. Using this system, NATSTATCOM updated the central household registration files effective January 1, 1996, and the information that was used for the sampling frame was as up to date as possible. The procedures followed in the stratification and identification of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were similar for all rounds of the KPMS as discussed below. 

Formation of Strata 

Initially the country was divided into seven (7) strata defined by oblasts (Oblasts are administrative divisions of the country which in turn are sub-divided in to Rayons) and by residence location (i.e. urban vs. rural) within oblasts. The rural portion of Bishkek oblast was combined with the rural portion of neighboring Chui oblast for stratification purposes as Bishkek has practically no rural population.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The KPMS surveys were carried out using a household questionnaire and a community (population point) questionnaire. The household questionnaires were used to collect demographic information on the composition of the household, housing, household consumption including home production, as well as economic activities in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. For each household member, individual level data on health, education, migration and labor was collected using the household questionnaires. Community questionnaires were used to collect price data and the presence of social services and infrastructure in the community (population point) where the sampled household is located. 

The household questionnaire was extensive and required several hours of intense interviewing to gather all that was needed from each household and its embers. The household questionnaire was split into two parts. The first part was used to collect data through a face to face interview on household roster, dwelling, education, health, migration, etc. At the end of the first part, members who shop for food for the whole household and those who know most about income, expenditure and savings of other household members were identified and designated as respondents for the next part (second round). The second round of interview was administered two weeks after the first half and collected data on crops, food and animal products produced by the household, food expenditure and home produced food consumption. 

Some sections of the household questionnaire such as those that deal with dwelling and expenditure information were administered to the person most knowledgeable of the family's overall expenditures, income and other finances as well as about the family's business activities and employment. In other sections, each adult in each sample household was interviewed individually. The information gathered from each household included extensive data on education, health, employment, migration, reproduction and reproductive health (for women aged 15 to 49), land use, expenditure, revenue and other financial matters, as well as anthropometric measurements (for children 5 years and younger). Information about children under 14 years of age was collected by asking the relevant questions to the adult household member who is primarily responsible for each child's care. 

The community (Population Point) questionnaires were administered to each sample cluster. They were used to collect data on prices of goods and services, distance to schools, shopping and medical facilities, types of housing, commercial and private land use and availability of infrastructure. 

HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE

The KPMS household questionnaires generally contain 15 major sections, and each of these sections covers a separate aspect of household activity. In some cases, the section has sub-sections. These household questionnaires were designed to better assess the changing environment brought about by the advent of a market economy and to enable a more in depth analysis of topics such as housing, health, and education. The various sections of the KPMS household questionnaire are described below.The household questionnaires administered in the KPMS surveys are more or less similar with minor modifications and additions in the successive rounds of the KPMS. 

POPULATION POINT QUESTIONNAIRE
 
The community (population point) questionnaire was used to collect information and data that are relevant to the community/population point where the household is located. The questionnaire was designed to be administered in the geographical area of each sample cluster. It was used to collect data regarding prices of goods and services in the local area and data on community infrastructure. Respondents to these questionnaires are those believed to be well informed members of the community that the interviewers identified by going to the rayon, city, oblast administration or other governmental agency located in the population point6. The questionnaire also contains sections to be administered to retail outlets in the neighborhoods that sell various products such as food, drinks, tobacco products and fuel. Other data collected using the population point questionnaire includes distance to schools, distance to shopping and to medical facilities, commercial and private land use in the community, availability of electricity, water, communication and other infrastructure. Similar population point questionnaires were used in all KPMS. The population point questionnaires were completed by the field supervisors. The population point questionnaire contains nine (9) major sections","SURVEY MANAGEMENT AND PREPARATIONS

Conducting the Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Surveys (KPMS) and the overall coordination of project related activities were mandates of the NATSTATCOM. Research Triangle Institute (RTI) of the United States was contracted to provide technical assistance to NATSTATCOM in relation to most of the KPMS activities. 

Once the final schedule for the KPMS surveys had been established by NATSTATCOM, a number of early survey preparations were done. These included the finalization of the statistical sampling design, the creation of survey training manuals, finalization of survey field forms and instruments, and the planning for and selection of appropriate staff to assist with the surveys, both from within the Central NATSTATCOM and from the oblast (regional) statistical offices. 
Representatives of various ministries who made up the users' group were provided with draft copies of both the Household and Population Point Questionnaires in each round of the KPMS. The group members provided insights to the various modules of the questionnaires based on their sectoral knowledge. 

Training manuals and field forms were created for the proper administration of the KPMS surveys. Final translations of the survey instruments into Russian and Kyrgyz were completed and the instruments printed. Field Supervisor and Field Interviewer Manuals were also prepared. Two copies of the final sample cluster household listings were given to each oblast office so that the oblast coordinators and field supervisors would have their own copies. 
To properly staff the survey field operations within each oblast, the number of clusters expected from each oblast and the number of households expected from each cluster were calculated and this information was also given to the oblast coordinators. With assistance from the survey team, the oblast coordinators identified the proper locations of clusters within their oblasts for field supervisors and field interviewers. Supervisors and interviewers were assigned on a full-time basis for the whole period of data collection. Generally these supervisors and interviewers were NATSTATCOM oblast employees and this was a key to the success of the survey operations. By having supervisors and interviewers who already reported to the oblast coordinator (or NATSTATCOM Chairman) in their regular jobs, the chain of command was already established, well understood and adhered to. 

Other preparations for the survey included the identification and procurement of appropriate anthropometric equipments. These included scales (for weighing sample household family members) and measuring tapes (for measuring the upper arms, waist and hips of the members). Although the anthropometric procedures were simple, care was taken in the preparation of proper instructions that clearly define these procedures. 

A Data Entry Operator's Manual was also prepared. This manual provided full instructions for entering the data, quality control measures to be taken and preparation of the final data files to be taken to the NATSTATCOM central office. 

TRAINING OF SURVEY STAFF

Training was given to field staff at several levels sequentially in the following order: central office staff, oblast coordinators (the NATSTATCOM chairman in each oblast), field supervisors, and field interviewers. The appropriate training materials were also developed. 

The NATSTATCOM oblast coordinators (chairmen) and the field supervisors attended training both in Bishkek and in their respective oblasts. The initial training in Bishkek focused on proper survey administration, quality control and financial management. 

Care was taken in training to review the procedures for locating and identifying sample households within the sample clusters selected. This training was reinforced by careful review and further explanation of the actual sample listings provided, for each cluster, to both the field supervisors and field interviewers. The importance of correct ID numbering and field quality control procedures by both interviewers and supervisors was stressed throughout the training. 

On the last day of each training session, extensive consultation was done to ensure a clear understanding of the materials, and what is expected from each trainee and the procedures to be followed in conducting the interview. Survey supplies and anthropometric equipment were then distributed. 

After the completion of the training for field supervisors and field interviewers, training was given to data entry staff at the NATSTATCOM central offices followed by training of the data entry staff in each oblast. The software used for the data entry was BLAISE III, a product of the Department of Statistics for the Netherlands.  The data entry personnel at the central office were trained first. This was followed by training at the oblast level via visits to each oblast. Data entry training in oblasts were conducted following a few weeks of survey data collection. Thus these data entry people were able to use actual data from a backlog of completed questionnaires for their hands-on training. 
The key data entry people were first trained about the overall data entry procedures for two days. They then started to enter the actual survey data while, at the same time, their work was closely supervised as a quality control measure for about two more days. Key entry personnel who had problems were retrained and brought up to a proper quality level or replaced. Oblasts with too few key entry personnel were provided assistance from the central NATSTATCOM key entry staff. Upon completion of the data entry at each oblast, diskettes containing all data were sent to the central office (NATSTATCOM) for compilation, final editing and cleaning. All population point questionnaires were keyed by the central office data entry staff.","In analyzing the KPMS datasets, there are two weighting variables that should be used to extrapolate results nationally. These variables are 'Weight' and 'Expansion Factor' and are included in the consumption/expenditure aggregates of the 1997 and 1998 KPMS datasets. The 1996 expenditure aggregate does not have these variables, but average comparative weighting factors can be derived using the inverse of the sampling rate. Weight is a variable derived as a product of household size multiplied by the expansion factor and it is used for household level variables. Expansion factor is a variable that is used for individual level variables.",,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged by including a citation which would include:

However, the Fall 1996-1998 KPMS surveys used a new sampling frame based on the Kyrgyz Household Registration System. This system was taken from the Census Posts intended for use by the first National Census of the Kyrgyz Republic. Using this system, NATSTATCOM updated the central household registration files effective January 1, 1996, and the information that was used for the sampling frame was as up to date as possible. The procedures followed in the stratification and identification of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were similar for all rounds of the KPMS as discussed below. 

Formation of Strata 

Initially the country was divided into seven (7) strata defined by oblasts (Oblasts are administrative divisions of the country which in turn are sub-divided in to Rayons) and by residence location (i.e. urban vs. rural) within oblasts. The rural portion of Bishkek oblast was combined with the rural portion of neighboring Chui oblast for stratification purposes as Bishkek has practically no rural population. 

Selection of PSUs and Households 

A total of 198 PSUs were identified for the whole of the Kyrgyz Republic of which 138 were in urban and 60 were in rural areas. The total number of households in the Kyrgyz Republic, as of January 1996, was about 1.1 million of which about 442,000 were classified as urban. It was initially targeted to select clusters of 6 responding households from each urban PSU and 20 responding households from each rural PSU (which would give us a total of 138*6 + 60*20=2,028 sample households). It was initially assumed that a 90 percent response rate would be attainable (though given the higher response rates obtained in the prior surveys, it could even be higher). The overall adjusted sampling rate was set at 1/500. It was then concluded that this overall sampling rate, combined with the projected response rate of somewhat above 0.90 would yield a sample size of close to 2,000 respondent households. 

Once the strata and PSUs were formed and identified, selection of sample PSUs and households was then carried out in the following order: 

1) Selection of large and small towns12 
[Note: For the 1998 KPMS, large towns were defined as those with a population size of 41,125 or larger. Small towns are those with population less than 41,125. This number, according to a NATSTATCOM document was calculated as follows: n=4.7*350*25. This calculation was based on an estimated household size of 4.7, an estimated interval rate of 350 and an average work load per interviewer of 25 households. No further information is available regarding the bases of such an assumption. At the moment, we do not have information about the cut off number that separates large towns from small ones for the other two KPMS.] 

2) Selection of Census Posts in urban areas 

3) Selection of Ayil Kenshes (village authorities) and population points in rural areas, and 

4) Selection of households from selected Census Posts and Ayil Kenshes. 
In the rural stratum of each oblast, villages were used as the listing units and within these listing units, equal probability sampling methods were used to select the ultimate sampling units (households). 
In urban areas, the centralized computer listings from various sources of household registration were used for the selection of households. These lists are categorized into four: 
Type 1 - Private house resident households listed by BTIs 
Type 2 - Public house residents listed with other organizations with dormitories only 
Type 3 - Public and private households listed by JSKs 
Type 4 - Public and private households listed by all other organizations. 
In some cases, private households were included in the last three public categories (Types 2, 3 and 4). However, only public households were selected from these types since it was believed that any private households listed in these category types were also included in the Type 1 category. The counts for Type 2, 3, and 4 lists were then adjusted based on the oblast estimates of all urban households.13 Prior to actual household sample selection, lists from types 2 to 4 were updated and adjusted to remove private households, so that any potential double eligibility was eliminated. Urban strata were then formed within each oblast based on type of household listing. In most cases, types had to be combined to form strata of a reasonable size. 

Within the limits of rounding and requiring at least one sampling unit per stratum, the allocation of sampling units to urban strata was proportional to the number of households projected for that stratum after allowing for removal of duplicates (private households appearing on a BTI and other lists). 

As for rural households, selection of urban households was done using systematic random sampling within each stratum except that more subdividing of urban lists was required before selecting the final list sample that defines each sampling unit. 

Even though the list sources were identified and sampled using data as of January 1, 1996 (and using projections of unduplicated counts in some cases), the final listings were updated in the field just prior to the survey period. Therefore, the sample households in selected areas were drawn from the most current available listings.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The KPMS surveys were carried out using a household questionnaire and a community (population point) questionnaire. The household questionnaires were used to collect demographic information on the composition of the household, housing, household consumption including home production, as well as economic activities in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. For each household member, individual level data on health, education, migration and labor was collected using the household questionnaires. Community questionnaires were used to collect price data and the presence of social services and infrastructure in the community (population point) where the sampled household is located. 

The household questionnaire was extensive and required several hours of intense interviewing to gather all that was needed from each household and its embers. The household questionnaire was split into two parts. The first part was used to collect data through a face to face interview on household roster, dwelling, education, health, migration, etc. At the end of the first part, members who shop for food for the whole household and those who know most about income, expenditure and savings of other household members were identified and designated as respondents for the next part (second round). The second round of interview was administered two weeks after the first half and collected data on crops, food and animal products produced by the household, food expenditure and home produced food consumption. 

Some sections of the household questionnaire such as those that deal with dwelling and expenditure information were administered to the person most knowledgeable of the family's overall expenditures, income and other finances as well as about the family's business activities and employment. In other sections, each adult in each sample household was interviewed individually. The information gathered from each household included extensive data on education, health, employment, migration, reproduction and reproductive health (for women aged 15 to 49), land use, expenditure, revenue and other financial matters, as well as anthropometric measurements (for children 5 years and younger). Information about children under 14 years of age was collected by asking the relevant questions to the adult household member who is primarily responsible for each child's care. 

The community (Population Point) questionnaires were administered to each sample cluster. They were used to collect data on prices of goods and services, distance to schools, shopping and medical facilities, types of housing, commercial and private land use and availability of infrastructure. 

HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE

The KPMS household questionnaires generally contain 15 major sections, and each of these sections covers a separate aspect of household activity. In some cases, the section has sub-sections. These household questionnaires were designed to better assess the changing environment brought about by the advent of a market economy and to enable a more in depth analysis of topics such as housing, health, and education. The various sections of the KPMS household questionnaire are described below.The household questionnaires administered in the KPMS surveys are more or less similar with minor modifications and additions in the successive rounds of the KPMS. 

POPULATION POINT QUESTIONNAIRE
 
The community (population point) questionnaire was used to collect information and data that are relevant to the community/population point where the household is located. The questionnaire was designed to be administered in the geographical area of each sample cluster. It was used to collect data regarding prices of goods and services in the local area and data on community infrastructure. Respondents to these questionnaires are those believed to be well informed members of the community that the interviewers identified by going to the rayon, city, oblast administration or other governmental agency located in the population point6. The questionnaire also contains sections to be administered to retail outlets in the neighborhoods that sell various products such as food, drinks, tobacco products and fuel. Other data collected using the population point questionnaire includes distance to schools, distance to shopping and to medical facilities, commercial and private land use in the community, availability of electricity, water, communication and other infrastructure. Similar population point questionnaires were used in all KPMS. The population point questionnaires were completed by the field supervisors. The population point questionnaire contains nine (9) major sections","SURVEY MANAGEMENT AND PREPARATIONS

Conducting the Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Surveys (KPMS) and the overall coordination of project related activities were mandates of the NATSTATCOM. Research Triangle Institute (RTI) of the United States was contracted to provide technical assistance to NATSTATCOM in relation to most of the KPMS activities. 

Once the final schedule for the KPMS surveys had been established by NATSTATCOM, a number of early survey preparations were done. These included the finalization of the statistical sampling design, the creation of survey training manuals, finalization of survey field forms and instruments, and the planning for and selection of appropriate staff to assist with the surveys, both from within the Central NATSTATCOM and from the oblast (regional) statistical offices. 
Representatives of various ministries who made up the users' group were provided with draft copies of both the Household and Population Point Questionnaires in each round of the KPMS. The group members provided insights to the various modules of the questionnaires based on their sectoral knowledge. 

Training manuals and field forms were created for the proper administration of the KPMS surveys. Final translations of the survey instruments into Russian and Kyrgyz were completed and the instruments printed. Field Supervisor and Field Interviewer Manuals were also prepared. Two copies of the final sample cluster household listings were given to each oblast office so that the oblast coordinators and field supervisors would have their own copies. 
To properly staff the survey field operations within each oblast, the number of clusters expected from each oblast and the number of households expected from each cluster were calculated and this information was also given to the oblast coordinators. With assistance from the survey team, the oblast coordinators identified the proper locations of clusters within their oblasts for field supervisors and field interviewers. Supervisors and interviewers were assigned on a full-time basis for the whole period of data collection. Generally these supervisors and interviewers were NATSTATCOM oblast employees and this was a key to the success of the survey operations. By having supervisors and interviewers who already reported to the oblast coordinator (or NATSTATCOM Chairman) in their regular jobs, the chain of command was already established, well understood and adhered to. 

Other preparations for the survey included the identification and procurement of appropriate anthropometric equipments. These included scales (for weighing sample household family members) and measuring tapes (for measuring the upper arms, waist and hips of the members). Although the anthropometric procedures were simple, care was taken in the preparation of proper instructions that clearly define these procedures. 

A Data Entry Operator's Manual was also prepared. This manual provided full instructions for entering the data, quality control measures to be taken and preparation of the final data files to be taken to the NATSTATCOM central office. 

TRAINING OF SURVEY STAFF

Training was given to field staff at several levels sequentially in the following order: central office staff, oblast coordinators (the NATSTATCOM chairman in each oblast), field supervisors, and field interviewers. The appropriate training materials were also developed. The training schedules for KPMS 1996 and 1998 were as follows: 
1) Central NATSTATCOM staff training (in Bishkek) -- This training took place between October 26 and November 1, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 10 to 15, 1998 for the 1998 KPMS. 
2) Oblast Coordinators and Field Supervisors from all oblasts (in Bishkek) -- This took place between November 4 and 10, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 19 to 24, 1998 for the 1998 KPMS. 
3) Field Interviewers in each oblast (at the oblast offices) -- This took place between November 11 and 18, 1996 for KPMS 1996 and between September 27 to 31, 1998 for KPMS 1998. 

The NATSTATCOM oblast coordinators (chairmen) and the field supervisors attended training both in Bishkek and in their respective oblasts. The initial training in Bishkek focused on proper survey administration, quality control and financial management. 

Care was taken in training to review the procedures for locating and identifying sample households within the sample clusters selected. This training was reinforced by careful review and further explanation of the actual sample listings provided, for each cluster, to both the field supervisors and field interviewers. The importance of correct ID numbering and field quality control procedures by both interviewers and supervisors was stressed throughout the training. 

On the last day of each training session, extensive consultation was done to ensure a clear understanding of the materials, and what is expected from each trainee and the procedures to be followed in conducting the interview. Survey supplies and anthropometric equipment were then distributed. 

After the completion of the training for field supervisors and field interviewers, training was given to data entry staff at the NATSTATCOM central offices followed by training of the data entry staff in each oblast. The software used for the data entry was BLAISE III, a product of the Department of Statistics for the Netherlands.  The data entry personnel at the central office were trained first. This was followed by training at the oblast level via visits to each oblast. Data entry training in oblasts were conducted following a few weeks of survey data collection. Thus these data entry people were able to use actual data from a backlog of completed questionnaires for their hands-on training. 
The key data entry people were first trained about the overall data entry procedures for two days. They then started to enter the actual survey data while, at the same time, their work was closely supervised as a quality control measure for about two more days. Key entry personnel who had problems were retrained and brought up to a proper quality level or replaced. Oblasts with too few key entry personnel were provided assistance from the central NATSTATCOM key entry staff. Upon completion of the data entry at each oblast, diskettes containing all data were sent to the central office (NATSTATCOM) for compilation, final editing and cleaning. All population point questionnaires were keyed by the central office data entry staff.","In analyzing the KPMS datasets, there are two weighting variables that should be used to extrapolate results nationally. These variables are 'Weight' and 'Expansion Factor' and are included in the consumption/expenditure aggregates of the 1997 and 1998 KPMS datasets. The 1996 expenditure aggregate does not have these variables, but average comparative weighting factors can be derived using the inverse of the sampling rate. Weight is a variable derived as a product of household size multiplied by the expansion factor and it is used for household level variables. Expansion factor is a variable that is used for individual level variables.",,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged by including a citation which would include:

Response rates were examined during the 1996 KPMS period to see if differential response rates for different strata might justify unequal weighting to reduce any potential bias during data analysis. the differences in response rates among strata were small, as the rates range from 0.905 to 1.000. The overall response rate was high (0.959) and, as expected, the response rate for rural strata was slightly greater than the one for urban strata. Under these circumstances, weight adjustment for nonresponse appears optional. For most analyses, it was believed that it would have little impact and would unnecessarily complicate the analysis. No such weighting adjustment was therefore done for all the KPMS surveys.","In receiving these data it is recognized that the data are supplied for use within your organization, and you agree to the following stipulations as conditions for the use of the data:

1) In discussions with NATSTATCOM staff, it was learned that the household registration that was used in the sampling process may not actually cover all resident persons. As more migration occurs, some residents may either be homeless or occupy housing units not included in the household registration system. It was pointed out that trends in household registration coverage need to be monitored in the future. If this becomes a serious problem, a move toward strict area probability sampling might be the only alternative that would provide near complete household population coverage. 

ii) A review of the sample selection process was conducted after the survey by a senior statistician on site in Bishkek. According to the review, field sampling steps were completed according to plan, but problems were encountered in four clusters with classifying households into the four types:
Type 1 - Private house resident households listed by BTIs 
Type 2 - Public house residents listed with other organizations with dormitories only 
Type 3 - Public and private households listed by JSKs 
Type 4 - Public and private households listed by all other organizations. 
As a result, too many households were selected and interviewed in these clusters. To insure appropriate level of representation in the sample from these clusters, only a subsample of the interviews from these clusters were retained for the final data file.",,,,

Likewise, the sample was stratified by location and population groups based on country of origin helping to account for the different economic realities from one part of the country to another, as well as differences between nationalities. Following discussion with the UNHCR country team and regional bureau, three geographic regions were presented for consideration : a) Southern Mexico; b) Mexico City; and c) the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor. Additionally, partners expressed interest in the Venezuelan community as a separate group, primarily residing in Mexico City, Monterrey and Cancun. The population of the four groups represents 67% of the active registered refugees in Mexico. Out of the 35,140 refugee households in the four regions, 26,688 families have at least one phone number representing an overall high rate of phone penetration. Across regions of interest, Hondurans make up the single largest group of PoC in Southern Mexico (38%), and the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor (43%), whereas Venezuelans make up over half of the PoC population in Mexico City (52%). Based on the above, a sampling strategy based on four separate strata was proposed in order to adequately represent the regions and sub-groups of interest: 1.

The methodology that was chosen reflects the purpose of the survey. To balance a desire for a large, representative sample with the expense of a detailed survey instrument, a sample size of 2,016 households was selected. Three separate populations were covered: households in Baku, households outside of Baku and households of Displaced Persons. Within each of those populations, the sample was chosen in such a manner that each household had an equal probability of being selected. At the same time, the logistics of locating the households and conducting the interviews within a specific time frame required that the households be grouped into ""work loads"" of 12 households each. The size of the workload was determined by the number of interviews that could be carried out in one day by one team of three interviewers and a supervisor.

The Azerbaijan Survey of Living Conditions sample design included 408 households in the eleven raions that make up the city of Baku, 1200 households in the population outside of Baku, and 408 households among the registered Internally Displaced Persons residing throughout the country. This results in an oversampling of the Internally Displaced Persons population and an undersampling of the urban population of Baku. In order to use all data to provide nationally representative estimates, weighting factors must be applied to the data to account for the difference between the population and sample distributions. 

Outside of Baku

The most recent data on population came from the 1989 census, the most recent data on number of households was reported in 1994 by the National Statistical Committee. The country is divided into towns, villages of the town type, and villages. Every household is located in one of those three types of population points. A list prepared by the National Statistical Committee contains just over 4,250 of these population points.
To choose the sample outside of Baku, Baku was excluded from this list as were all the population points located in raions of the country currently occupied (Agdam, Xankendi, Xodjali, Xodjvendi, Susha, Kubatli, Zangelan, Kelbadjar, Lachin, Fizuli and Djebrali). The remainder of the country included 3453 population points.
Information on the number of households was not available for all population points, specifically, ""villages of the town type"" and cities did not have this information. Average household size was calculated for those points that had both population and the number of households and this number was used to impute the number of households for those population points where it was missing. Average household size was 4.25 which is smaller than expected but reflects the fact that numerator is a 1989 statistic and the denominator is from 1994.
First stage of sampling: Using the list of actual and estimated number of households for each population point, 100 workloads were spread across the population points in the following manner:
1. the sampling interval, i, was calculated to be the total number of households outside of Baku divided by 100,
2. the random start, s, was calculated by taking the integer portion of [random number * i + 1],
3. the population point containing the sth household, the (s+i)th household, the (s+2i)th household, etc. were then selected.
4. in the event that more than one interval landed on the same population point, multiple workloads of 12 households were surveyed in that population point. In this manner 100 workloads were distributed in 91 population points.
Second stage of sampling: In order to select the households within the selected population points, household lists maintained by the administrative office of each Selsoviet were used. Selsoviets are administrative units that cover from one to ten population points. In the population points covered by a single group of 12 households, 16 dwellings were selected--12 to be interviewed and 4 to be used as replacements if necessary. The sampling interval used was the total number of households on the list divided by 16. Each population point had been assigned a randomly generated number with which to calculate a starting point. In population points with more that one group of 12 households, 16 households were selected for each workload and the sampling interval was number of households divided by 16 multiplied by the number of workloads.
It is possible that a second household with separate finances could occupy a dwelling that was only listed once in the Selsoviet’s list. If an interviewer discovered more than one family living in a single dwelling, separate questionnaires were to be filled out for both, and a household randomly selected from among the households not yet interviewed on the list for that population point was taken off the list. This replacement of households, opposed to adding households, was adopted because the schedule did not allow time for more than 12 interviews per workload.

Baku

In February of 1995, SORGU was commissioned to do a random sampling survey in Baku. At that time a list was compiled of 2000 households in Baku. The 2000 households were distributed across the 11 raions of Baku according to each raion’s proportion of the total population. In each raion, the passport office lists were consulted to select the required number of addresses. In each office, the depth of each drawer full of cards was measured, the total length was divided by the number of households to be selected from that raion and cards were then pulled out at those intervals. From each card a specific address in Baku was noted. There is one passport for each dwelling in that raion regardless of the number of separate household/family units occupied the dwelling. The passport lists are, in principle, continuously updated with information from the housing maintenance offices. However, dwellings that are used for business, unoccupied, abandoned or rented to foreigners may remain listed. Furthermore, it is not clear how new privately built housing units would be listed.The 408 households and 92 replacements for this survey were selected by choosing a random number between 1 and 4, starting with that number and then selecting every fifth address from the existing list.

Internally Displaced Population

The National Statistical Committee prepared a listing of population and number of households of internally displaced persons by raion in July 1995. From that list, 34 workloads of 12 households each were selected from 26 raions and 11 Baku Administrative Regions using with a sampling interval and a random start similar to the method used outside of Baku. Ten workloads were selected in Baku and 24 were selected in 17 raions. As before, some raions received more than one workload. In each raion, the administrative offices for the Ministry of Refugees was consulted to locate the internally displaced persons. Each office should have a list of internally displaced persons by households. An additional level of sampling took place to choose three places and four interviews will be conducted in each place. These places were buildings, towns, or tent camps depending on how the households were listed.

Sampling as Implemented

In the course of the field work, it was discovered that population lists are not maintained in major urban areas. In Kuba, Xachmas, Devichi, Qaxi, Sheki, Ali Bairamli, Gojai and Agdash, supervisors had to improvise. In some cases passport registration lists were used, as was done in Baku. In other cases electric users lists, gas office books and butter/meat coupon distribution lists were used in order to capture a sample that was as representative as possible. During field work, one population point, Xandar, was not accessible due to security concerns and its proximity to the occupied region. A second population point, Sofukent, was not accessible because of the weather. In both cases, it was not practicable to replace the population points with two other population points randomly selected from the national list. Instead, field teams were instructed to visit the nearest population point of approximately the same size to the chosen population point. The only major disruption to fieldwork occurred in Naxicevan where interviewers were shot at by terrorists, fortunately none was hurt.",Face-to-face [f2f],"DEVELOPMENT OF QUESTIONNAIRES

A questionnaire based on the Living Standards Measurement Study surveys was adapted for use in Azerbaijan. Significant reductions in the number of questions reflected the need to conduct the survey in a short period of time and the more limited scope of a poverty assessment as compared to a full-blown government policy analysis. Questionnaire development was done using the Russian language version. The finalized versions were translated into Azeri by SORGU personnel. A special version of the questionnaire with both Russian and English was prepared for use by data analysts.

DESCRIPTION OF QUESTIONNAIRES

The survey includes questionnaires at both the household and population point (community) levels. Population point is an administrative designation that can be a village, a ""village of the town type"" or a town. All households in the country belong to one population point. First stage sampling was based on population points and second stage sampling was based on the household lists in selected population points. The population point served as the community in the ASLC.

Both questionnaires reflect the content and methodology used in many LSMS surveys. The household questionnaire, was abridged significantly to conform to the time frame and purpose of the survey. LSMS surveys are often designed to facilitate the analysis of the impact of a broad range of government policies on households. The Poverty Assessment required an assessment of economic well-being of each household and several broad measures of employment, education, health, housing and other areas of household activity. The scope of questions asked in the ASLC was much narrower than for a standard LSMS especially in the field of economic activities. It covers all of the topics covered in most LSMS surveys but contains far fewer questions, and therefore, less detail. The household questionnaire collects information at the individual and household level on all aspects of life and activity. The population point questionnaire gathers information common to all households in the sampling unit, thus limiting the length of the household questionnaire. Information collected for the population point includes the type and quality of social services available, predominant economic activities, the distance to regional and national centers, and a price survey.

Household Questionnaire

The household questionnaire contains nine modules: demographic information, housing, education, health, economic activities, migration, consumption and expenditure, household property and agriculture. The entire questionnaire was administered to the head of the household. Interviews were generally carried out in the main room of the dwelling with other household members present. The household head was invited to consult with other household members but other household members were not interviewed separately. Interviewers were instructed to collect information for all people who usually reside in the dwelling, eat together and share expenses and anyone who was in the dwelling the night before the interview.

Section 1, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, collects the age, sex, relation to household head, marital status of all individuals, and the ID codes of the mother, father, and spouse if any of them are members of the same household so that children and parents can be linked. Section 1B gathers information on the sharing of expenses, length and reason of absence during the last 12 months. This information allows the researcher to vary, somewhat, the definition of household.

Section 2, DWELLING, gathers information on the size and type of dwelling, expenditures on rent or mortgage and utilities, source of water, heating, lighting and telephone for the household. These variables both reflect and have an impact on the health and welfare of the household members.

Section 3, EDUCATION, gathers information for all individuals 5 years and older on years of schooling and highest degree obtained. For household members who continue to study, information is collected on meals provided at school and reasons for absences of more than four weeks from school.

Section 4, HEALTH, collects, for each individual, information on health during the last 4 weeks, person from whom care was received, place where care was administered, and whether or not preventative care was received.

Section 5A, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME, is completed for all household members 7 years and older. Information on sector, position and renumeration for primary and additional work was collected. Part 5B gathers information on search for work, and other economic activities. Part 5C gathers information on additional sources of income for the household including the sale of food products, gifts, pensions and state allowances.

Section 6, MIGRATION, gathers information for all individuals 7 years and older on years lived at current residence, previous place of residence, reason for movement to current place, official residential status, and type of work done in previous place of residence. For households that include internally displaced persons (IDPs), Section 6B gathers information on the degree of contact with people from the place of origin and assistance currently received. 
Section 6C gathers information on the property that these displaced persons had before the displacement, that which they were able to bring with them and that which they lost. Section 6B and 6C represent a substantial departure from standard LSMS survey questionnaires.

Section 7, CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURES, gathers expenditures in the last month for 17 categories of expenditure in Section 7A and the amount spent, value of home production consumed, and value received as gifts for 20 categories of food products in Section 7B.

Section 8, LIST OF DURABLE GOODS, gathers information on durable goods currently owned by the household including year of acquisition and goods sold within the last 12 months by the household.

Section 9, AGRICULTURE, covers land ownership and agricultural activities, expenditures and revenues in Section 9A and the number and total value of agricultural assets including animals, vehicles and equipment in Section 9B.

Population Point Questionnaire

One population point questionnaire was completed for each sampling point. Interviewers were instructed to interview as many community leaders as necessary in order to complete the questionnaire.

Section 1, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, asks for information on population, ethnic composition, and migration.

Section 2, INFRASTRUCTURE, collects information on roads, electricity, water, sewer, and garbage collection in the community. There are also questions on the time and expense of a trip to the capital and regional center and on telephones, TV and newspapers in the community.

Section 3, ECONOMY, collects information on major economic activities, unemployment, the closing of state enterprises and the degree of independent economic activity.

Section 4, DISPLACED PERSONS, gathers information on the presence and living conditions of Internally Displaced Persons.

Section 5, EDUCATION, collects information on the proportion of girls and boys in school and the reason for non-attendance, the condition of the schools and whether there have been improvements or deterioration in the last 5 years.

Section 6, HEALTH, collects information on health problems of adults, children, and the effectiveness of health services, the place where women most often give birth, the existence of immunization campaigns in the last five years and the availability of drugs.

Section 7, AGRICULTURE, collects information on crops, agricultural activity, conditions and prevailing wage rates in the sector.

Section 8, INSTITUTIONS, collects information on the institutions in the community and for those that do not exist in the community, the distance and time required to reach the nearest one.

Finally, for each sampling point, three observations are made on the prices of 33 common food and household items.","Training and Field Test

All interviewers and supervisors used for the survey were experienced SORGU staff. Specific training for the Survey of Living Conditions was conducted in three stages. All interviewer candidates participated in a day long orientation seminar where the survey purpose, questionnaire content and format, and field work strategy were presented. Follow up training including mock interviews and careful review of each question was given to small groups of interviewers in several sessions. Supervisors were given individual training on the selection of households from the population point household lists, observation of interviews and questionnaire verification.

The field test was conducted in Baku and a town two hours north of Baku. The procedure for selecting households proved time-consuming but manageable. Government officials were accommodating and the households interviewed were very hospitable. During the pilot test interviews, most respondents found it impossible to answer questions on the value of the dwelling and durable goods as there was no market for those things. As a result, those questions were removed.

Organization of Field Work

Each household interview was conducted in a single session. The entire questionnaire was addressed to the household head, rather than individuals. In most cases, the entire household was present for the interview and the household head would receive help answering questions when appropriate.

Interviews in Baku were conducted by 5 teams from November 20-December 13, 1995. Ten teams conducted the interviews in the 100 population points and in 24 groups of IDPs outside of Baku between November 23 and December 20. Population points for workloads outside of Baku, households in Baku, and raions for IDPs were selected prior to the field work. Supervisors were responsible for the random selection of households in population points outside of Baku and the places and households for interviewing Internally Displaced Persons.","The three samples of households: outside Baku (PPID 100-199), Baku (PPID 1-34), and IDPs (PPID 201-234) are self-weighted for those three groups of households.(PPID is the variable name for population point identification code.) However, the number of households selected from each group do not correspond to the percent of the three groups in the national population.

To use all sample households to represent all households in Azerbaijan, weighting factors should be used. This weight is included as variable W in the PP data

The survey team was composed of 23 surveyors and 5 supervisors. Each enumerator was given a tablet and mobile phone (including sim card and data bundles) to be used for the interviews. The questionnaire was implemented using CsPro's CATI capabilities. Data were collected by trained INSD interviewers who individually made phone calls from their respective homes. Data from completed and partially completed interviews were synchronized each evening. 

2. Pre-loaded information:
Basic information on each household (such as location, household head name, phone number, etc.) was pre-loaded in the CATI assignments for each interviewer. The list of household members from the social registry data and their basic characteristics were uploaded. The aim of pre-loaded information is to assist interviewers in calling and identifying the household, and ensure that each pre-loaded person is properly addressed and easily matched to the most recent interviews. 

3. Respondents:
The survey had one respondent per household. The respondent was the knowledgeable adult household member or the head of the household. The respondent must be a member of the household and must be an adult. The respondent may still consult with other household members as needed to respond to the questions.","Both cross-sectional and panel weights are designed to adjust for differences in selection probability due to either design or non-response. In addition, further adjustments in sampling weights were made to ensure that indicators produced are representative of the country’s population, by poverty status and by location. The sampling frame, the social registry of the Ministry of Social Affairs, over-represents the poor and has an incomplete coverage of the upper distribution of income. To correct for these biases, we rely on a post-calibration approach, using the household budget survey of 2017 (EDAM 2017) as the reference data source. This is because EDAM 2017 survey was representative of the country’s population by poverty status and survey domains. However, EDAM 2017 survey is restricted to the first four consumption quintiles to ensure sufficient overlap of the universes covered by both surveys.","[{'name': 'Institut National de la Statistique de Djibouti', 'abbreviation': 'INSD', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Enumerators used their own mobile phone devices. Enumerators were given data bundles, allowing for internet connectivity and daily synchronization with the server. Data was sent to the server daily. 

Field Supervisors reviewed the survey with enumerators on a daily basis via one-on-one calls and were always available to address any concerns that arose while performing an interview. At the same time, a Research Analyst was in charge of checking the uploaded data daily to identify errors and notify supervisors so as to avoid further errors during ongoing survey implementation and future surveys. 

A dashboard was established and updated daily. The dashboard has information on individual enumerator performance, such as the number of calls logged, duration of calls, percentage of calls responded to and percentage of non-consents. Non-consent reason rates and attempts per household were monitored as well. The dashboard was also used to track overall survey completion and preview the results of key questions.

Field Supervisors made callback checks to a random subsample of households that completed a survey in Round 1.

A more detailed description of the questionnaire is provided in Table 1 of the Survey Methodology Document that is provided as Related Materials. Round 1 and 2 questionnaires available for download.","The Ethiopia- COVID-19 High Frequency Refugee Phone Survey of Households (RHFPS) was conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) techniques. The household questionnaire was implemented using the CATI software, SurveyCTO. Each enumerator was given a tablet which they used to implement the interviews, along with data bundles to be used on their own mobile phone devices. DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM: SurveyCTO's built-in data monitoring functions are used. Each enumerator was provided with a data bundle, allowing for internet connectivity and daily synchronization of their tablet. Data was sent to the server daily. 

During the roughly three-week period of data collection, each sampled household is called up to three times a day at different hours, with a minimum of three hours between each call, for a minimum of three consecutive days, and a total of nine attempts. The initial calls were made Monday to Saturday, 8:30am to 6:00pm. The respondent is one member of the household, typically the household head. Only in cases where the household head cannot be reached despite numerous call-backs, another knowledgeable household member is selected as the respondent.

When possible, a household interview is rescheduled outside of working hours and days if preferred by the respondent. Also, if a non-household member (usually a reference number for the intended household) was reached or a household member who is unable to answer questions received the call, the information of the household head or a knowledgeable household member is requested for completing the survey or a followed up plan with them is sought if unavailable. Once all these interview penetration strategies were exhausted with no positive response, the household is considered as non-response and was replaced with a different household from the replacement sample.
In each survey domain, additional refugee households are sampled to serve as replacement households in case of non-response.","To obtain unbiased estimates from the sample, the information reported by households needs to be adjusted by a sampling weight (or raising factor) wh. To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.
Additional technical details and explanations on each of the steps briefly outlined above can be found in Himelein, K. (2014).","[{'name': 'Laterite BV', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include: - the Identification of the Primary Investigator - the title of the survey (including country, acronym, and year of implementation) - the survey reference number - the source and date of download

This included formatting, and correcting results based on monitoring issues, enumerator feedback and survey changes. Data cleaning carried out is detailed below. 

Variable naming and labeling: 
• Variable names were changed to reflect the lowercase question name in the paper survey copy, and a word or two related to the question. 
• Variables were labeled with longer descriptions of their contents and the full question text was stored in Notes for each variable. 
• “Other, specify” variables were named similarly to their related question, with “_other” appended to the name. 
• Value labels were assigned where relevant, with options shown in English for all variables, unless preloaded from the roster in Amharic. 

Variable formatting: 
• Variables were formatted as their object type (string, integer, decimal, time, date, or datetime). 
• Multi-select variables were saved both in space-separated single-variables and as multiple binary variables showing the yes/no value of each possible response. 
• Time and date variables were stored as POSIX timestamp values and formatted to show Gregorian dates. 
• Location information was left in separate ID and Name variables, following the format of the incoming roster. IDs were formatted to include only the variable level digits, and not the higher-level prefixes (2-3 digits only.)  
• Only consented surveys were kept in the dataset, and all personal information and internal survey variables were dropped from the clean dataset. • Roster data is separated from the main data set and kept in long-form but can be merged on the key variable (key can also be used to merge with the raw data). 
• The variables were arranged in the same order as the paper instrument, with observations arranged according to their submission time.

Results of the backcheck survey are compared against the originally captured survey results using the bcstats command in Stata. This function delivers a comparison of variables and identifies any discrepancies.

• Daily SurveyCTO monitoring: This included outlier checks, skipped questions, a review of “Other, specify”, other text responses, and enumerator comments. Enumerator comments were used to suggest new response options or to highlight situations where existing options should be used instead. Monitoring also included a review of variable relationship logic checks and checks of the logic of answers. Finally, outliers in phone variables such as survey duration or the percentage of time audio was at a conversational level were monitored. A survey duration of close to 15 minutes and a conversation-level audio percentage of around 40% was considered normal. 
• Dashboard review: This included monitoring individual enumerator performance, such as the number of calls logged, duration of calls, percentage of calls responded to and percentage of non-consents. Non-consent reason rates and attempts per household were monitored as well. Duration analysis using R was used to monitor each module's duration and estimate the time required for subsequent rounds. The dashboard was also used to track overall survey completion and preview the results of key questions. 
• Daily Data Team reporting: The Field Supervisors and the Data Manager reported daily feedback on call progress, enumerator feedback on the survey, and any suggestions to improve the instrument, such as adding options to multiple choice questions or adjusting translations. 
• Audio audits: Audio recordings were captured during the consent portion of the interview for all completed interviews, for the enumerators' side of the conversation only. The recordings were reviewed for any surveys flagged by enumerators as having data quality concerns and for an additional random sample of 2% of respondents. A range of lengths were selected to observe edge cases. Most consent readings took around one minute, with some longer recordings due to questions on the survey or holding for the respondent. All reviewed audio recordings were completed satisfactorily. 
• Back-check survey: Field Supervisors made back-check calls to a random sample of 5% of the households that completed a survey in Round 1. 
Field Supervisors called these households and administered a short survey, including
(i) identifying the same respondent; 
(ii) determining the respondent's position within the household; 
(iii) confirming that a member of the the data collection team had completed the interview; and

It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless, where sampling approaches differ across strata. For refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, as well as for stateless people, recently conducted Socioeconomic Surveys (SES), were used as sampling frames. For the refugee population living in urban areas and the Dadaab camp, no such household survey data existed, and sampling frames were based on UNHCR's registration records (proGres), which include phone numbers. For Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and urban refugees, a two-step sampling process was used. First, 1,000 individuals from each stratum were selected from the corresponding sampling frames. Each of these individuals received a text message to confirm that the registered phone was still active. In the second stage, implicitly stratifying by sex and age, the verified phone number lists were used to select the sample. Until wave 7 sampled households that were not reached in earlier waves were also contacted along with households that were interviewed before.  In wave 8 only households that had previously participated in the survey were contacted for interview. The “wave” variable represents in which wave the households were interviewed in.  For the stateless population, all the participants of the Shona socioeconomic survey (n=400) were included in the RRPS, because of limited sample size. The sampling frames for the refugee and Shona stateless communities are thus representative of households with active phone numbers registered with UNHCR.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire included 12  sections

The information, for example the household's location, household head name, phone numbers etc, was used to help enumerators call and identify the target households. The list of individuals from the UNHCR registration data and their basic characteristics were uploaded as well as basic information from previous survey waves where available from wave 2 onward.","Sampling weights for the refugee and stateless samples were tailored to the respective sampling strategies. Kakuma and Kalobeyei sub-samples have used the baseline weights from the respective SES underlying the sampling frame to adjust for any differences in the sampling probabilities. Then, propensity score weighting based on the full population covered in the SES household survey, have been used to account for differences in the probability of owning a phone number. The estimated propensity score reflects the household probability to have a phone number registered by UNHCR. To mitigate the effect of outlier estimates, the mean propensity score is computed for each decile. The baseline weights are then multiplied with the inverse of the propensity score deciles. For the refugees living in Dadaab camp and urban areas, a cell weighting approach has been used. Thereby, the sample is split into sub-groups (cells) based on the gender and age group of household head. The weights were then scaled such that they reflect the proportion of each cell in the UNHCR registration data of all refugees living in the respective location. In the group of stateless people registered with UNHCR, each household has the same weight assigned, as their full population is called in this survey. Lastly, to ensure sampling weights have the correct proportions across strata, they have been scaled to match population totals as provided by the up to date UNHCR registration data. Variable: weight
The data is also weekly representative for all waves except for wave 8. The variable weight_weekly should be used for weekly representative estimates.
Panel Weights 
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals: 
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1 
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples 
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups 
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile 
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac 
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2) 
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2
The balanced panel weights including waves 3, 4, 5, 6,7 and 8 were constructed using the same procedure. Variables: weight_panel_w1_2_3, weight_panel_w1_2_3_4, weight_panel_w1_2_3_4_5, weight_panel_w1_2_3_4_5_6, weight_panel_w1_2_3_4_5_6_7 and weight_panel_w1_2_3_4_5_6_8.","[{'name': 'Vyxer', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]",UNHCR (2022). Socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on refugees in Kenya - Panel - Anonymized for Licensed Use.  Dataset downloaded from https://microdata.unhcr.org on [date].,,"Variable names were kept constant across survey waves. For questions that remained exactly the same across survey waves, data points for all waves can be found under one variable name. For questions where the phrasing changed (even in a minimal way) across waves, variable names were also changed to reflect the change in phrasing. 
Extended missing values are used to indicate why a value is missing for all variables. The following extended missing values are used in the dataset: 
·	.a for 'Don't know'
·	.b for 'Refused to respond'
·	.c for 'Outliers set to missing'
·	.d for 'Inconsistency set to missing' (used for employment data as explained below)

More detailed data on children was collected between waves 3 and 7, compared to waves 1, 2 and 8. In waves 1 and 2, data on children, e.g. on their learning activities, was collected for all children in a household with one question. Therefore, variables related to children are part of the 'hh' data for waves 1 and 2. Between waves 3 and 7, questions on children in the household were asked for specific children. Some questions covered all children, while others were only administered to one randomly selected child in the household. This approach allows to disaggregate data at the level of the child household members, and the data can be found in the 'child' data set. The household level weights can be used for analysis of the children's data. In wave 8, detailed information on children was dropped, as the questionnaire focused on other topics.
The education status of household members, except for the respondent, was imputed for rounds 1 and 2. For rounds 1 and 2, only the education status of the respondent was elicited, while for later rounds the education status for each household member was asked. In order to evaluate outcomes by the household member's education status, information on education was imputed for waves 1 and 2, using the information provided for all household members in waves 3, 4, and 5. This resulted in additional information on the education status for household members in round 1 and 2, which was not yet available for earlier versions of this data.
Some questions are not asked repeatedly across waves such that their values were imputed.  For some questions, answers are not possible or unlikely to change within two months between survey waves such that households were not asked about them in all waves. The questions on assets owned before March 2020 were only asked to households when they are interviewed for the first time. The questions on the dwelling's wall and floor material as well as the household's connection to the power grid was not asked for all households in wave 2 and 3, where only new households and those who moved were covered by these questions. Questions on the main source of electricity in the households and types of assets owned were not asked in wave 8. The missing values those variables have when they were not asked, are imputed from the answers given in earlier waves.
Improved quality insurance algorithms lead to minor revisions to wave 1 to 5 data. Based on additional data checks, the team has made minor refinements to wave 1 to 5 data. The identification of the household members that were the respondent or the household head was refined in the rare cases where it was not possible to interview the same respondent as in previous waves for a given household such that another adult was interviewed. For this reason, for about 2 percent of observations the household head status was assigned to an incorrect household member, which was corrected. For <1 percent of households the respondent did not appear in adult level dataset. For about 1 percent of observations in wave 5 the respondent appeared twice in the adult level dataset. 
Data from questions on COVID-19 vaccinations from wave 7 was dropped from the dataset. Due to significantly higher self-reported vaccination rates compared to official administrative records, data on vaccinations was deemed unreliable, most likely due to social desirability bias. Consequently, questions on vaccination status and questions using the vaccination data as a validation criterion were dropped from the datasets.","[{'name': 'Curation Team', 'affiliation': 'UNHCR', 'email': ' microdata@unhcr.org', 'uri': ''}]","1.0, November 2020

The sampling procedure had two steps. The sample was stratified according to the 18 pre-war regions—which are the country’s first-level administrative divisions—and population types. This resulted in 57 strata, of which 7 are IDP, 17 are nomadic, 16 are exclusively urban strata, 15 exclusively rural, and 2 are combined urban-rural strata. The sample size in some strata was too small, thus urban and rural areas were merged into one single strata; this was the case for Sool and Sanaag.

Round 1 of the COVID-19 SHFPS was implemented between June and July 2020.

The phone survey data collection was conducted through a call center. A gender-balanced call center team who can communicate with respondents in local language was selected. The call center used a TeleSom multi-line phone system accessed through laptops. This system allows user to dial any phone number in Somalia across the four main Somali phone networks (TeleSom, Somtel, Gollis, and Hormuud). The system used land-based technology rather than Voice Over IP to improve call quality.","To ensure the representativeness of the distribution of Somali households by state and population type, each household observation was adjusted by a sampling weight.

Based on the sampling design, sampling weights were calculated after the completion of data collection. Sampling weights were calculated with two goals: i) to correct for the selection bias generated by the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) protocol, namely to correct for the under-coverage of households that do not have access to a mobile phone, and ii) to ensure representativeness of the distribution of Somali households by state and population type. The first is achieved using a Propensity Score Weighting (PSW) methodology. To this end, the probability of being included in the phone survey is estimated and observations with a lower probability of being included are given a higher weight. The second is achieved using a post-stratification methodology. The final weight combines a propensity score weight and a post-stratification weight.

In Round 2, cross-sectional weights (CSW) were calculated for all households interviewed in round 2.

Reaching rural and nomadic-lifestyle respondents proved to be difficult in a phone survey setting due to lifestyle considerations and relatively lower phone penetration compared to urban settings. To overcome this challenge, the following were performed:
- Lowering the sample size of the rural stratum
- Reducing the number of interviews in the oversampled urban strata of Kismayo (Jubaland – Lower Juba/Urban) and Baidoa (South West State – Bay/Urban)

The social registry is an official database of households in Djibouti that may benefit from public transfers and be particular targets of poverty alleviation efforts. The sample consists of households drawn randomly from the social registry data restricted to urban households having at least one phone number and interviewed after July 1, 2017.
 
The sample design is a one-stage probability sample selected from the sampling frame and stratified along two dimensions: the survey domain (three categories) and the poverty status (binary). This yields six independent strata. Within each stratum, households are selected with the same ex-ante probability but this differs across strata. Initially 1,590 households are drawn. Given a non-response rate averaging 30 percent, a replacement sample of 750 households was selected. About 589 of these replacement households have been contacted to reach the overall goal of 1,486 completed interviews.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire is adapted from the template questionnaire prepared by the Poverty and Equity GP to measure the impact of COVID-19 on household welfare.

- Knowledge and Behavior Regarding the COVID-19
- Employment
- Household's Income
- Needs

The survey team was composed of 23 surveyors and 5 supervisors. Each enumerator was given a tablet and mobile phone (including sim card and data bundles) to be used for the interviews. The questionnaire was implemented using CsPro's CATI capabilities. Data were collected by trained INSD interviewers who individually made phone calls from their respective homes. Data from completed and partially completed interviews were synchronized each evening. 

2. Pre-loaded information:
Basic information on each household (such as location, household head name, phone number, etc.) was pre-loaded in the CATI assignments for each interviewer. The list of household members from the social registry data and their basic characteristics were uploaded. The aim of pre-loaded information is to assist interviewers in calling and identifying the household, and ensure that each pre-loaded person is properly addressed and easily matched to the most recent interviews. 

3. Respondents:
The survey had one respondent per household. The respondent was the knowledgeable adult household member or the head of the household. The respondent must be a member of the household and must be an adult. The respondent may still consult with other household members as needed to respond to the questions.","Both the population and household weights are designed to adjust for differences in selection probability due to either design or non-response. Each weight is a combination of a design weight and a post-stratification weight, accounting for non-responses. In addition, further adjustments in sampling weights were made to ensure that indicators produced are representative of the country's urban population, by poverty status and by location. The sampling frame of the social registry over-represents the poor and has an incomplete coverage of the upper distribution of income. To correct for these biases, we rely on a post-calibration approach, using the household budget survey of 2017 (EDAM 2017) as the reference data source. This is because EDAM 2017 survey was representative of the country’s population, poverty status and survey domains. However, EDAM 2017 survey is restricted to the first four consumption quintiles to ensure sufficient overlap of the universes covered by both surveys. Thus, the results presented in this report are representative of the country’s urban population except for the top 20 percent of the richest.","[{'name': 'Institut National de la Statistique de Djibouti', 'abbreviation': 'INSD', 'affiliation': 'Government of Djibouti'}]","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

1. Receiving and spending the cash assistance (basic facts)
2. Risks and problems: Did people face problems with the CBI? Did the CBI put POCs at additional risk?
3. Markets and prices: Can POCs find what they need, and at a price they can afford, in the markets?
4. Expenditure: What did people spend the money on?
5. Outcomes: What changes is the cash assistance contributing to in POC households?
6. Longer-Term Outcomes: Has the cash assistance helped put POC on the pathway to sustainable solutions?
7. Accountability to Affected Persons: Is the CBI intervention accountable to persons of concern? (What preferences do people have over how assistance is delivered?)

1. Post-Distribution Monitoring: The total number of beneficiaries households of Cash-Based Interventions in April 2020 was 5,124. For this part of the survey (CBI PDM), a random sample of 89 refugee households was drawn from all vulnerable urban refugee households registered to receive cash assistance.
2. Rapid Needs Assessment:  In addition to the 89 sampled households, who were also answering this part of the survey, a random sample of 91 households, who were not receiving cash assisstance, was selected from all urban refugees and asylum seekers registered with UNHCR (5,286).",Telephone interview,,,"Sample weights were calculated for each of the two parts of the survey differently, as the inverse of the probability of selection of the household.","[{'name': 'UNHCR', 'abbreviation': '', 'affiliation': ''}]","UNHCR (2020).
